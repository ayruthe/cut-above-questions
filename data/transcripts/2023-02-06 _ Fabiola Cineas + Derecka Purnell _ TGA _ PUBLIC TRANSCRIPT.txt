TITLE: Best of: Imagine a future with no police

SUBTITLE: Vox’s Fabiola Cineas speaks with author and activist Derecka Purnell about a 
radical new vision of policing in America
     
DESCRIPTION: Guest host Fabiola Cineas talks with author, lawyer, and organizer 
Derecka Purnell about her recent book Becoming Abolitionists. They discuss Derecka's 
journey to defending the idea of police abolition, and what that position really entails. They 
explore questions about the historical and social role of policing in society, how to imagine a 
future where we radically rethink our system of criminal justice, and how we can 
acknowledge and incorporate current data about crime — while still rethinking our inherited 
assumptions about police.
This was originally released in Jan. 2022 as an episode of Vox Conversations.

Sean Illing: Hi, it’s Sean. Today on the show, we’re re-airing an episode from January of last 
year. It’s a conversation about policing in America, and in light of the killing of Tyre Nichols, we 
think it’s really important. Later this week, I’ll also be talking with law professor and former police 
officer Rosa Brooks about this complex topic. But for now, here’s my brilliant colleague, 
Vox.com race and policy reporter… Fabiola Cineas.
INTRO - COLD:
Fabiola Cineas: The killing of Tyre Nichols by five police officers in Memphis, Tennessee is the 
latest, horrific example of police brutality in America. 	
I haven’t watched the video of the officers pepper spraying, tasing, chasing, kicking, clubbing, 
and punching Nichols during a traffic stop, which led to his death — but… I’ve read the 
comparisons to the 1991 Rodney King beating… and, I’ve listened to the cries of his grieving 
family members. Reports say that during the fatal beating, Nichols called out.. for his mom.
The fact that the officers were all Black, as is the police chief, and that they were all quickly 
fired.. and now face charges.. including second-degree murder — doesn’t mean policing has 
improved. 
Police still kill more than 1,000 Americans every year and it was nearly 1,200 in 2022 — the 
deadliest on record. And unarmed Black people are killed by police at three times the rate of 
unarmed white people.
The conversation about the need to change policing reached a high point in 2020 following the 
police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, which incited some of the biggest protests 
the country has ever seen. 
But, since then, Congress has failed to do anything, like pass the George Floyd Justice in 
Policing Act, which would have ended qualified immunity for police officers. And it’s worth 
pointing out… much of the reform options that have been proposed and debated in the past couple 
years wouldn’t have saved Tyre Nichols.

It’s why years after ideas like defund and abolish the police reached the mainstream, we’re still 
wondering… What would America look like if we poured its large police budgets into other public 
safety measures, into health care, into education, and into housing? What would society look 
like without the police?

ID: I’m Fabiola Cineas, and this… is The Gray Area.

INTRO - HOT:
My guest today is Derecka Purnell. She’s a lawyer and activist whose 2021 book Becoming 
Abolitionists chronicles her journey from police abolition skeptic to someone now dreaming up a 
world without the police. Derecka’s work holds a mirror up to the institution of policing and 
questions not only its origins… but who it serves — and harms — today. 

I spoke to Derecka a little over a year ago about what it was like to grow up and call the police 
for everything… but then to realize that the people you’re calling for help can hurt you. And, of 
course, we discuss some common questions she gets like — what about rape and murder… 
and wouldn’t Black women be some of the most vulnerable people in a society without the 
police? 

But I wanted to start by taking a step back. What does it really.. even.. mean.. to call yourself a 
police abolitionist?


music 

Derecka Purnell: I mean that I belong to a tradition, a generation, a group of people who are 
committed to eradicating the violence from police prisons, surveillance, prosecutors, right? 
The entire carceral state, and committed to eradicating violence in our society at the same 
time, over time until all of this is obsolete.
Fabiola Cineas: Mmm. That is not a simple answer. 
I just want to get a sense of how you're feeling in this moment. I feel like you've been in the 
hot seat for a while now. I've watched since like early 2020 people just outright dismiss your 
abolitionists visions. How does it feel to champion an idea that people seem to hate so much, 
but then at the same time, it's an idea that's being so well received. People are talking about 
abolition in a way that, I don't think we've talked about before. 
Derecka: Well, it depends on the people. I feel very lucky that there have been lots of 
organizers, scholars, thinkers, people in our community who've been organizing around 
abolition for decades, quite literally before I've been born. And so I'm coming in literally on 
the tail end of so much of the groundwork that's been laid by people who've come before me. 
And just, how lucky am I to be an inheritor of that tradition? Right? Abolition has always been 
unpopular even since slavery, right? There were debates around whether there should be an 
anti-slavery movement or an abolitionist movement. There are critiques of abolition from the 
left, from the right, from liberals or conservatives.
So usually the most progressive stances in our society have always been under fire because 
the status quo is much easier to maintain it. If you have a media, if you have corporations. So 
many people who have the power to maintain oppression, controlling the narrative and the 
money. And so, yeah, I don't know if I've been in the hot seat any more than anyone who has 
been fighting to do this work for decades, centuries, even. And I just feel lucky to be in their 
tradition.
Fabiola: So in the beginning of your book, you talk about how the idea of abolition actually 
used to repulse you. So that's a pretty strong thing to say for someone who is championing 
abolition so strongly right now. So can you walk me through that journey? When did you first 
learn of abolition as a concept and what really drew you in?
Derecka: Yeah. So I first learned about abolition as a concept, maybe as a child, right? 
Because I learned about the abolition of slavery. I learned about the history of black people 
on plantations, who were running away to get free, who engaged in the insurrections, who 
were plotting rebellions, who were orrating who were traveling throughout the country 
building an underground railroad.
And so my first contact with abolition generally was through the context of slavery, which is 
also the context in which many abolitionists today draw on when we talk about contemporary 
abolition is particularly in response to the prison industrial complex. 
But when I was in college, I would hear organizers and activists talk about abolition at 
meetings or protest. And I honestly just didn't even know what they were talking about. It's 
just hearing the word abolition or police abolition or prison abolition, or even the abolition of 
borders. I just didn't take them seriously. I said, oh, you want to abolish police? Like where, 
how, like why, what are we going to do with all the bad people? All of the horrible people? I 
mean, my response, my repulsion mostly came from a place of ignorance and just not really 
grappling or taking time to understand what these people meant when they were saying 
abolition. And it's not because I wanted to keep police, necessarily, or I wanted to keep 
prisons necessarily it's because like most people in this country, my ideas about policing 
and about prisons were largely unexamined. Right? I hadn't taken time ever to really think 
about where did police come from? What's their role, purpose, function in this society? Do 
we need them in the way that I've been conditioned to believe that we need that?
And so I was dismissive and repulsive because I was just didn't take those activists 
seriously. And then years later, by the time I started studying and being pushed to think 
about abolition from other organizers and scholars and people who were in the community 
surrounding Cambridge, I was shocked to learn about the abolitionist project and still had 
lots of questions. I still have lots of questions. But it was very different from what I initially 
thought it was when I first heard it, you know, more than a decade ago.
Fabiola: And how does being a member of the Trayvon generation factor into your quest to 
learn more about abolition? 
Derecka: Well, there are so many of us, when I say many of us, I mean, people who are a part 
of what Elizabeth Alexander calls the Trayvon generation. Who watched Trayvon get killed. 
Watched George Zimmerman go free and have since continued to watch videos of police 
killings go viral. 
But in 2012, after Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman, me and so many other 
people across the country, we went into the streets to demand that the police arrest George 
Zimmerman, and we called that justice. We said that we wanted justice for Trayvon. And what 
justice meant at the time for me, and for many other people is that George Zimmerman not 
only had to get arrested, but also had to get convicted, right. That there also needed to be a 
change in laws, like stand your ground, that were basically helping lots of white men get 
away with murder.
And so I watched organizations that eventually became the Dream Defenders. And I watched 
the formation of BYP 100. I watched all of these groups just catalyze a movement that was, 
the primary demand was to get someone arrested. And then from 2012 to 2014, 2015, and the 
aftermath of the Ferguson uprising, I watched the same people that I organized with, I 
demanded justice with, I watched them become police and prison abolitionists. I watched 
them grow and ask questions. I watched them become revolutionaries and engage in critical 
thinking and political education and form campaigns to close jails, to remove money from the 
police. 
And so what I really love about the book is that it gave me a little bit of space to talk about the 
political evolution of people like Charlene Carruthers and Phil Agnew. And I mean so many 
different people right now who we see espouse abolition as politics, but it didn't happen 
overnight.
Fabiola: And as you said before, abolition is definitely not a new concept. Like for me right 
now, I'm reading this book called The Black Jacobins. It's like the definitive account of the 
Haitian revolution published in 1938. And I'm like blown away by chapters that talk about the 
Maroons, right? Just groups of people who've fled and lived in the mountains for decades 
and decades and would come down here and there to try to get this revolution started. And 
it's like, I never learned about these things in school. So it's just like abolition does have a 
very long history, but it sounds like you're also kind of forging a new kind of abolition where 
you're saying, I don't think that capitalism and abolition can coexist. 
So can you talk a little bit about your specific brand of abolition and how it might differ from 
people who were talking about abolition some decades ago? 
Derecka: Yes, absolutely. The word brand makes me a little bit nervous. So when they say my 
particular brand of evolution, it's ironic because you're asking me about capitalism and I'm 
nervous about abolition becoming a brand. But I think about the tradition of abolitionists that 
I'm in. And we can go to somewhere like WEB Dubois who was very excited and who affirmed 
lots of white abolitionists like Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner for taking up the cause 
to help free black people from slavery. 
And W.E.B. Du Bois, he did something else in Black Reconstruction, right? He is also critical 
of white abolitionists who were committed to the rapid capitalist industrialization of the 
United States. He considered it just a huge flaw in their activism and in our organizing, you 
know, for black people. 
And so even the tradition of abolitionists that I see myself and it's related to W.E.B. Du Bois's 
critique of former abolitionists who were committed to ending oppressive institutions, but 
who are not critical or refuse to hold a serious analysis of the way that capitalism was 
becoming, rapidly becoming a destructive force in the United States.
And so when I think about W.E.B. Du Bois, when I think about the black socialists and black 
communists, who said, we charge genocide in the 1950s, right? They were criticizing the US 
government and they were pointing to all of the violence in our communities, including police 
brutality through an anticapitalist framework.
Right. And I think about that all the way down to people who are developing analysis around 
the prison industrial complex, and we read Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Mariame Kaba, or Angela 
Davis, right? People who espouse anticapitalist politics, because they know that capitalism 
creates so much inequality in the United States.
We are looking at the coronavirus right now. You know, we have people who are losing jobs. 
There's an eviction crisis. There's so much more poverty. And yet billionaires are getting 
more money. And what happens with that inequality, prisons, police, prosecutors. They 
ultimately become the managers of that inequality.
And so we can't just abolish the prison industrial complex. So we can't just end mass 
incarceration and keep capitalism intact. And so I see myself in that longer line of tradition. 
What has changed is the way that capitalism manifests. So it doesn't look the same as it did 
in the 18 hundreds or the early 19 hundreds. Right. We have new tenants of capitalism that 
we need to fight, you know, because it's at least attempting to convince lots of poor people, 
black people, people of color, indigenous people that you can work your way up in it. There's 
a lot of social mobility if we just rely on capitalism, we have politicians save a very capitalist 
to the bones, right? So we have to figure out how to fight the narrative that capitalism is a 
salvific economic option in this country because it's really causing so much devastation that 
the police ultimately manage.
Fabiola: So I want to talk some more about how we develop the attachment that we have to 
the police in the United States. I grew up in New York city. When I was in high school, senior 
year, I was violently mugged in my neighborhood in Brooklyn. And it's kind of a crazy story 
because it happened so fast. Like I was coming out of the train station with, two of my 
friends. It was around like five o'clock. So the sun was already down because it was like fall 
season. I had a bag on my shoulder. It was like college application season. So I had my 
laptop in there. I had important like paperwork for the colleges that I was filling out.
When I was, like, coming out of the train, these two guys just come up behind me and they 
just tug really hard on my shoulder, pull my bag. I try to, you know, stop them from getting it. 
They get it, they start running. What was crazy is I decided in my mind, it wasn't like, Oh, my 
God, let me grab my phone and call the police. I decided to chase them down. I was like, what 
I need right now is my bag. Yeah. So I started chasing these two guys up Nostrand Avenue in 
Brooklyn and the one who had my bag went down like a dark little street and the other one 
who didn't have my bag, like one up toward Eastern Parkway. I'm chasing the one with my 
bag, but then when we like, kind of get to the middle of the block, he slows down and I kinda 
got scared. I'm like, Oh no, maybe he might pull out like a knife or a gun or something. Let me 
stop. 
So // then I went back and joined my friends. They had no idea what happened. And it was 
only then when I was like, I guess I should call the cops. So I called the police, tell them what 
happened. They were like, alright, we'll send someone out. And we weren't too far from a 
precinct in Brooklyn. They show up maybe like 20 minutes later I described what happened. 
They took me down to the station. They actually sat me down with a sketch artist. I described, 
uh, what the two guys look like. I assume they put pictures up around the neighborhood or 
just kept it in their file. 
And then in the weeks after I did ride-alongs with the cops, so they would be like, yeah, meet 
us at this time. We'll take you around. So they parked me outside of, like, some basketball 
courts in the neighborhood. We sat outside of like popular restaurant. 
Derecka: Oh my gosh.
Fabiola: Yeah. And it was, it was fascinating because I'm like, here I am, my bag with my 
laptop was at this point stolen like three weeks ago. And I'm like sitting out in a car, like 
doing a lookout with the 
Derecka: Oh, my gosh.
Fabiola: yeah, it got to a point where I was like, all right, this is okay. Thank you so much for 
your efforts.
Derecka: wait. They were getting paid and you were sitting there helping them volunteering.
Fabiola: basically. Yeah. Basically seeing, trying to see if I could see these guys and I did feel 
uncomfortable. A part of me was like, oh, this is nice of the cops to like, invest their time and 
doing this. But then I was also like, I'm not going to get my bag back. Also, if I see these guys 
on the court, I'm not going to sit and point them out. Like, it felt weird. 
And so whenever I think of, like, abolition or calls to the front of the police, I always think 
back to that interaction that I had with police officers. Cause it was kind of like the crime 
wasn't prevented. you know, my bag was long gone. I still wasn't safe. You know, my mom, 
whenever I would leave the house was still like. Be careful, don't take your phone out on the 
train. And this was during the height of stop and frisk. So we, there were cops everywhere. 
And so even with knowing that in that small moment, the police didn't help me out. There was 
still this idea in my mind of like, okay, I guess things are better because there are cops 
standing, you know, on my block in Brooklyn patrolling.
So can you just talk about why you think so many people hold on to the police as just 
something, as you also describe in your book? 
Derecka: Well, thank you for sharing that story. And I'm so sorry that happened to you. It's 
not fun, obviously, getting your important things stolen. 
When I was sick with COVID last year, I was too sick to bring my bike in out my car. And the 
next morning I went outside, my bike was gone. It was my birthday gift. I had only had it for a 
few months and I was so sad. And so, yeah. It's not fun to have things stolen. It sucks. It's 
tragic. 
And so I think that people hold onto the idea of policing for lots of reasons. I think one, like I 
did, it's largely unexamined. Police appear as normal neutral fixtures of our society for a lot 
of people like, oh yeah, we have teachers, we have post office workers. We have cops, we 
have counselors. They're presented as first responders. When cities try to raise money for a 
medical emergency services. What do you see, you see police, fire and paramedics, all 
listings. So they're interwoven as normal fixtures of our society, despite the violent origins of 
their history. And despite the continued practices that they do every day. 
I think that's one reason that I don't know if enough people have asked, why do we have, why 
is this the case that our society is set up like this, you know, and great thing about social 
movements and about activism, that it compels people to ask critical questions about the 
kinds of people we are and the kinds of society that we have, right. Someone had to ask, why 
is it that gay people can't get married in the United States? Or why is it that women can't get 
abortions in the United States? Right. People have to ask them, force these questions, 
because if you don't, then you can assume that's a very oppressive set of relationships that 
we have the very oppressive institutions that we have are normal. So we need more people to 
engage in activism so that we can compel others to think critically about what we have and 
ask to have something better.
A second reason why I think we hold on to the idea of policing is because the people who 
continue to lobby to give more money to the police are people who also have lots of power. 
And they essentially present a dichotomy to people, you know, they've had their 
neighborhoods divested of services, people who live in ghettos and class-exploited 
neighborhoods, people who don't have democratic control over their schools. And then you 
have people in power saying, well, you're gonna experience crime and violence if we don't 
have police, wouldn't you rather just reform them? 
Right. And so what I think it's on abolitionists to explain is that, well, we're not only trying to 
make police obsolete. We're also trying to figure out actually how to prevent violence, how to 
prevent the violent mugging that you just described. Right. We're not trying to say, well, you 
know, someone can just come and take her book bag, and then there's not going to be 
anyone for you to call. That's not the goal of abolition. Abolition is at least the tradition I 
belong to. We're asking why are people selling book bags off of trains? Why does someone 
steal my bike out of my car? Right? Like, why is it that the overwhelming majority of people 
who experience theft in this country are people who are poor, right? The people who get the 
most taken from them are people who are poor, who are living in trailers, who are living in the 
apartment complex and project housing.
And they're mostly are experiencing theft and robberies and burglaries from other people 
who are poor. So if we had less inequality, perhaps there would be significantly fewer 
muggings, or people wouldn't be lurking in the middle of night to take out a bike to sell it for 
whoever knows what, right. So how can we reorient our society to fight the massive 
inequality that exists because of capitalism, because of racism, because of ableism. Instead 
of just relying on police to be barely responsive actors to the inequality, which is what we 
have right now. 
And here's the thing, all of that, you said for three weeks, you were riding around with the 
police? The amount of labor that Brooklyn or the city of New York paid for, for those cops to 
do the patrol work with you, it could have bought you another laptop.
Fabiola: That's a fair point.
Derecka: It could have bought you several laptops, several. And so we are literally, we're 
getting police, we're paying them thousands and thousands of dollars to replace things that 
are a few hundred dollars. It makes no sense. It makes no sense, but instead you were doing 
ride-alongs and they literally, they put you in jeopardy of potentially identifying someone. 
You know, that person may be going to jail. Maybe they're going to get a record and then 
what's going to happen? They're going to get out of jail with a record. It's going to be hard for 
them to get a job. It's gonna be hard for them to get housing. And they're going to probably 
steal again, because they need to survive.
Right? So it's like, well, how do we actually disrupt the cycle by addressing the actual 
inequality and not just using police to be responsive to it?

Liberal opponents to police abolition usually hold the banner for quote-
unquote reform –  a catch-all term that can imply anything from the 
introduction of body cameras to setting up a civilian review board. 

But for abolitionist Derecka Purnell, reforms like these don't go far enough.

I’ll ask her why, after a quick break.

 

MIDROLL 1
 


music 

Fabiola: So I do want to get into this idea that the police can be reformed. There are so many 
people, especially liberals, especially liberal politicians who many of us really look up to who 
say, you know what, we hear what you're saying to defund movement. We hear what you're 
saying, abolitionists. Maybe not saying that, but ,they're saying, you know what, in the past, 
for example, if we take community policing right Biden, when he was campaigning in 2020, it 
was saying we just have not put enough money toward community policing. It was never fully 
funded. So we need to continue with that program.
Why do you say that police reform isn't the answer and I'll list off some other reforms, 
whether it's like community oversight boards, we have the banning of chokeholds. We have 
diversifying police forces, you know, just have more chiefs who are black, for example. Why 
aren't these reforms enough, according to what you've argued many times.
Derecka: for so many reasons, for so many reasons.
We can look at diversity for example. Many of the police departments around the country are 
absolutely very diverse. New York City has a very diverse police department. Baltimore, St. 
Louis all have varied, diverse police departments, and still the brutality is still there. We can 
look at a place like Puerto Rico where maybe 100% of the offices there are Puerto Rican, and 
yet they are one of the most violent policing institutions that belong to the United States. 
And so diversity, what it does, unfortunately, it discourages people of color from filing 
complaints against cops, right? It's like, well, I don't know if this encounter was obviously 
racist because now I have a black cop who stopped me and frisking me. And I don't like it, 
but I don't know if I'm going to go to the police department and say, you know, what this 
black cop did was racist. And so we see where there's community policing and diversity, we 
see a decline in people reporting cops from misconduct. It has a perverse effect, one major 
reason. 
Second major reason many of these reforms don't work is that they don't get to the heart of 
what policing does, which is manage inequality. And so let's say I'm a, I'm a homeless 
person.
I'm sleeping under a bridge and police come, especially if I'm in St. Louis, they spray water 
on the ground so that the ground freezes over to stop homeless people from sleeping in front 
of city hall. Let's say this, right? Let's say all those cops are white or all of those cops are 
mean, and they curse at people when they tell them to move off the sidewalk. Now let's say, 
let's do this with community policing. Let's make all of these cops so much more nice. Let's 
make them more friendly. They could bring water, they could bring donuts and hot chocolate 
to pass out to people who are homeless. At the end of the day, whether it's the most angriest, 
racist, violent cop, or whether it's the nicest politest, gayest, womanest, blackest cop. At the 
end of the day, their job is to move those homeless people from one part of the city to 
another, right? They're not undermining the homelessness. They're not finding people 
housing. They're not pushing back on inequality.
At the end of the day, they're carrying out the interests of the corporations who occupy 
downtown centers, and they want to make sure that they're maintaining the aesthetics, the 
appearance, oh, this is a nice, fancy, neat looking downtown center. We can’t have homeless 
people with their blankets and our tents everywhere. 
So it doesn't matter if you have a subjectively better cop, right? With a good personality who 
volunteers on Sundays at church at the end of the day, your favorite cop is primarily 
responsible with enforcing inequality. So we can reform them so they can enforce inequality 
better. We could put body cameras on them so we can watch how they enforce inequality. We 
can have all of the volunteer programs, the coffee with the cops, books and badges 
programs. They can hand out ice cream. At the end of the day, what they're primarily doing is 
finding better ways to manage inequality.
So community policing sounds great, especially if you've experienced being harassed, 
stopped and frisked, ticketed, sexually assaulted. If you've experienced militarized policing, if 
you've been teargassed like I have, and your options are militarized policing or community 
policing, hell yeah! community policing sounds great. It's like, give me that. Right? I want 
that. 
But those are false choices. Community police is a better, efficient way to obscure the true 
violence and function of policing, which is to manage inequality, locking up tens of millions 
of people every year. And the overwhelming majority of those people are poor. I don't need a 
nicer cop to lock up poor people. I need people who are committed to fighting inequality and 
fighting policing itself.
Fabiola: Yeah, that makes me think of, um, the example of Camden county and how a lot of 
people love to look at Camden as this model for police reform. 
So in 2013, Camden disbanded its police force, and then it kind of rebuilt it and replaced it 
with a county-wide one. And crime did decrease, right? So looking at numbers from a 
Reuters story, the police reported 1,161 violent crime incidents in 2019. And that was down 
42% since 2012. And then excessive force complaints also dropped. So three were reported, 
um, and registered in 2019 down from 65 in 2014. But then there are also reports of this 
program just being copaganda. Like yes, the, the crime rate has gone down, but it's also a 
matter of aggressive policing, policing that's focused on broken windows policy and also just 
surveillance.
So there is a piece from Brendan McQuade in The Appeal. And it talks about how police, from 
July to October, 2014, the Camden county police wrote up 99 tickets for riding a bicycle 
without a bell. And they basically struggled to process about 125,000 different cases, citation, 
tickets that were issued by the new force between 2013 and 2014. And so it was like a 97,000 
case increase from the previous year. And most of those cases were for petty offenses. 
So what is your response to the fact that data is skewed? It looks like even, there are studies 
that show policing works to decrease crime. So if we look at different strategies like 
deterrence or hotspot policing, like one study, for example, found that deploying police in 
high crime areas was associated with less crime in New York City. 
So I just threw a lot at you, but just any kind of comment on the fact that there is some 
research that suggests that policing can be successful to reduce crime. But then it's also 
like, should we be thinking of crime reduction as our only goal to society, to bettering 
society? 
Derecka: Yeah. I mean, that's a fair question. I think the first thing I would speak to right now 
is Camden. 
So what happens with police reform. And I will absolutely call it copaganda, is that it zooms 
in on what changes have been made with policing in the city like Camden. 
What often gets failed to mention alongside policing, is that especially in Camden, is that the 
poverty rate in Camden fell, it dropped significantly at the same time that people were touting 
that all of these reforms in Camden was improving policing. They failed to mentioned that 
poverty had also declined in Camden because the state of New Jersey was trying to 
incentivize companies to move there in order to like catalyze the economy.
And so when, again, inequality decreases, we see less violence because people aren't 
stealing bookbags from, like, young black girls getting off of trains in New York City. Right? 
So there was a drop, a decrease in inequality, but yet the inequality goes out the window, the 
poverty rate, all of that conversation goes out the window about how that actually reduces 
harm. And then the focus is, or look clearly, this was the police MO. All these other factors 
happened. If we look at the government. So accountability office when they analyze the 
results of the crime bill, they say, well, putting all these additional officers on the street, only 
yielded about a 2% reduction in what we call crime. 
What actually caused more reduction of crimes was all of these developments in education, 
early childhood education, job growth in these areas, in these different communities. And so 
what's bad usually about the police literature is that it looks at police in isolation and it 
doesn't take into account other economic programs that are happening. Other shifts in 
education that are happening, the rise of mutual aids in particular neighborhoods, even with 
black churches, the level of mutual aid and charity that black churches do in areas where 
violence is reportedly higher, none of that gets taken to account in these research studies 
where it says, well, we put 18 more cops on this block every day for the past year, right?
So we can't just have such a narrow research focus because then we applaud the results of 
that without looking at the full context of what happens in that city.
Fabiola: So does that mean that a combination of policing and increased social services can 
lead to the kind of society that you envision?
Derecka: I mean, by your own example, do we want police to be giving tickets to people who 
are riding bikes who don't have bells, right? Cause right now that's the combination that we 
have. We have people who are still being ticketed for silly arbitrary offenses. We still have 
about 15,000 murder, homicides every year in the United States. I don't think that the 
combination is effective. 
And one significant reason — and this is related to the lack of context that affirms that more 
police presence  one significant reason is because police often sabotage alternatives to 
policing. And so we see where the street violence  interruption programs throughout the 
country, the ones that are not ran by police, police have an antagonistic relationship to them. 
Right. We see police spraying spray paint in different gang territory to catalyze violence. We 
still see the use of informants. Right? We see the surveillance list for people who haven't 
even done any harm, haven't done the crime, but yet they're on these watch lists. I don't think 
that's the society that I want to live in. I think that we can do much better than that and what 
we're continuing to pay police in billions, all of those resources could actually be shifted 
towards reducing the inequality that police are then sent to go and manage.
Fabiola: And there's also the argument that accountability is what we need, right? 
Accountability will improve policing. So Derek Chauvin, what happened in that trial was 
unprecedented. The fact that there were people in his own department willing to speak up 
against him and say what he did to George Floyd was completely unlawful.
So is there an avenue where holding police officers accountable and really holding them to 
task, uh, with their behavior. Is there any way that that could help us achieve the society that 
you envision. 
Derecka: I don't think so. I don't think so for lots of reasons. One, what happened with Derek 
Chauvin I wouldn't say is unprecedented at all. Yet, police still continue to kill more than 
three people a day. Even with the rise of police convictions, we still see them kill more than 
three people a day. 
Often when cops get convicted, sometimes they get prison time. And if they do, they don't 
get the same amount of prison time that lots of other people who commit similar offenses do, 
even though they're supposed to be technically holding up the law. So we see less 
punishment, less prison time for cops who are engaged in egregious behaviors. 
And then I'll say two more things about this. The accountability, especially with the police 
convictions, it doesn't necessarily take into account if a Supreme Court grants police with a 
power to make violent calls in split second decisions, right? The court says, look, police 
officers, they don't have time to be weighing what's going to be the full consequences of my 
actions if I need to stop violence, that I is alleging that is happening, right?'' I have the power 
to make a split second decision based on my best judgment about this particular situation. I 
get to deploy force or I get to shoot. I get to hurt someone and I have the power to do that 
with a split second decision-making that has been granted by the Supreme Court. 
So if the court says cops have to make split second decision-making in determining when to 
use force, do we think in that split second that the court says cops have all the time and 
they're going to say, wait, wait, wait. Before I pull this trigger, remember Derek Chauvin was 
convicted of killing George Floyd, right? According to the court's own logic, they don't have 
time to make those calculations. And so we're trying to assume that the punishment that 
they're going to receive through a court conviction will then offset what the Supreme Court 
says that they don't have to consider. So that's not going to work. 
The second reason that's not going to work, is that again, we can use Derek Chauvin. Let's 
say that Derek Chauvin, he's going to go to prison I think for 20 years. The next cop who puts 
his knee on someone's neck over using a ledge, counterfeit $20 bill, let's say that person 
doesn't die. Let's say they live. Let's say they live and they go to a hospital. Or let’s say they 
live and go straight to jail. Let's say a cop does it for five minutes instead of 10 minutes. 
Right. Nothing's going to happen. There would be no protests, no uprisings. 20 million people 
are not going to go into the street every time a cop harms someone by putting their body into 
their neck, if that person does not die. 
And so if we only can count on convictions and accountability and that justice when 
someone is killed by the police and not the daily mundane stops and frisks, hits, assaults, 
intimidation, that's what’s at stake, right? Not the spectacular killings that go viral, but the 
everyday nature of policing, that is what's at stake. 
And then, so the accountability, it doesn't speak to how violent everyday policing is. And 
then unfortunately using those spectacular cases to try to stop police from being so violent, 
it's just not going to lead us to a lot of success.
Fabiola: And I've watched people get curious about abolition, and a lot of black women too. 
Right. but they'll stop engaging when they get to the, what do we do about the rapists? Won't 
we still have murderers. What do we do with them? How do we address the rise in crime? 
Like in 2020, the U S 's murder rate went up by almost 30%. So people seem eager to get to 
these gotcha moments to try to counter the abolitionist imagination. 
But then it's also a legitimate fear within us of just like, we're not safe. We're not going to be 
safe. 
How do you approach that? 
Derecka: Well, I want to respond quickly. So I don't know if that statistic is accurate that the 
murder rate increased by 30%. and the murder rate has also been historically low over the 
last, like 30 to 40 years. 
Fabiola: Yeah. So more information is just that the murder rate went up in 2020, but crime 
overall fell by four or 5% in 2020. 
Derecka: And there's also disputes around the 30% figure from the FBI and from the New 
York Times. So, yeah, I didn't, I didn't want to just respond to the question without 
contextualizing again the statistics.
Fabiola: Absolutely. 
Derecka: I think what’s also very specific even about the murder rate that is jumping is the 
context of which is jumping. And so I know that since COVID has happened, we have 
experienced deep deep deep inequality. We see people lose jobs. We see people lose homes. 
We've seen the government for several months give people $600 or $1,200 to live on. And so 
the more inequality that we expect in this society, the more violence and harm that's going to 
happen as a result of it. And so with a rising inequality, I am shocked, honestly, that violence 
isn't higher than what it is. Right. I am honestly shocked. I think if it had not been for the 
robust mutual aid and sharing and interventions that people have tried to do for each other. 
You know, I don't know where the violence rate would be.
So we can't look at that murder rate out of context. Right. And even with the responses to 
COVID, the police has still been getting more and more and more funding, right. The police, 
businesses, like they continue to get funded. Sometimes it's so tragic to me knowing what 
has happened in the last year with the spikes in the homicide, like yeah, we have to 
absolutely be responsive. 
But here's the thing. There are nearly a million cops, so like 700,000 cops, there's 18,000 law 
enforcement agencies. And they all got huge grants from the federal government to do 
policing. Now, if policing is inadequate to the spike in murders, why do we think that more 
policing will then contribute to a decrease? Like why do we think that? Just logically it 
doesn't even make sense. Right. 
And so let's say that there is a 30% spike in murder rate. Well, why? Well, because of the 
inequality that we've experienced during the pandemic, and rather fighting to make sure that 
people can stay in their homes, that they get more assistance. What do we see? We see the 
expiration on eviction moratoriums. We see states deciding to reopen prematurely. 2000 
people died in the last 24 hours [In January 2021]. We're talking about parents. We're talking 
about people who earn money and resources for their families. We're talking about 
caretakers and babysitters and teachers and friends and loved ones, right? So we're seeing 
more vulnerability and more precarity. 
And until we have an actual robust, courageous response to the pandemic, the violence is 
going to continue and we cannot police our way out of it. Hell, police are refusing to even get 
vaccinated. They are boycotting vaccines. They're contributing to the crisis. And then they're 
being paid to go, manage it.
And so I think it's absolutely tragic what's happening right now. And I'm again, so grateful for 
all of the organizers and organizations who have been committed to helping people pay rent, 
to pay their mortgages, to feed themselves, to feed their children, to come up with pods so 
that students can learn when schools were closed, I am so grateful for organizations that 
passed out masks at the time where the federal government were telling people not to buy a 
mask. Or school districts were penalizing students who were coming to class with masks on. 
I am so grateful because had there not been a robust community based response, I think the 
violence would be even higher. Abolition is not to be anti-accountability or pro violence. What 
we're saying is that police isn't working. So we need to come up with better robust responses 
to inequality and to policing because as long as we choose to invest in the latter, then 
inequality is going to continue and we're not going to actually get to the root causes of harm.

music 

That all sounds great, but… would any of this actually work? 

That’s a typical follow-up question that an abolitionist might hear – maybe 
even from a progressive. What about people who are just… determined to 
steal, vandalize, or hurt people?

After one last short break, I’ll ask Derecka: would abolishing police make us 
less safe?

 

MIDROLL 2
 

music 

Fabiola: So something that I see people tend to do, um, in conversations about abolitionists. 
First, they say, oh, that's a utopia because getting rid of the root causes of crime still won't 
address people who are naturally inclined to hurt other people. 
What is your response to that? Like, do you believe that humans are just inclined to be 
violent and want to kind of get over on other people or, or is that capitalism? Is that our 
socialization that has caused us to be this way? Right? Like the person who took the bike 
from your car? 
Derecka: Well, if I had to make an assumption about the kind of person who took the bike for 
my car, I would assume that they probably don't, I don't know, own a home or have lots of 
resources and wealth. I would assume that they're not lurking the streets, like trying to steal 
bikes from people's cars because they live a comfortable life. If I had to make that 
assumption. 
When I used to steal from my mom and from my grandmother, it was because I didn't have 
money. Like I don't know why we mystify why people commit harm. Like when I do these 
trainings with abolitionists groups, I ask them, I say, raise your hand, you know, if you have 
ever been a victim of, like, theft, if someone has ever stolen from you, everyone raises their 
hand. And then I'll say, raise your hand if you've ever stolen from somewhere. And then 
people will like go raise their hand. Everyone will start laughing. And then eventually you will 
see that people steal from each other for lots of different reasons.
And so, I don't know, I'm a person of faith, I guess I'm a Christian or whatever. I think that 
there is like bad things that people do. The overwhelming majority of violence is not because 
they're just people who are born that way. And if, so, one question I do ask to those people 
who will say, you know, some people are just evil. Some people are just wicked, I'll just ask, 
well, do they all just happen to live in the United States? Right? When we look at the level of 
mass shootings in this country, compared to other countries, do all the people who are just 
born evil, just all happen to live here, or is it that we have more guns that we have people in 
this country. And we have a Congress who refuses to do anything about that. Right. Like why 
are there 15,000 homicides here every year and not in other places similar populations? 
Why is it that the inequality is so massive here and not in other parts of the world, right? Why 
is sexual violence against indigenous people so high, you know, in the United States? So it 
could just be the case that, yeah, there are just evil people in the world. They're all just born 
in the United States, but I don't think that's true. don't think that's the case. 
I think that we are deeply socialized in the United States around violence. And what 
abolitionists are trying to do is undermine that socialization and put forward a different way 
of being in the world and it's not going to happen overnight. We're not going to eliminate 14, 
15,000 murders overnight— homicides overnight rather, but what we can do as well, we can 
change the social relationships in the United States. So that by the time we actually get, I 
don't know, down to a thousand homicides or 200 homicides, maybe we can have better 
accountability in a way that's caring and thoughtful in the way that actually might prevent 
other harm or actually might take it account the real circumstances and offer some relief for 
the survivors and the person who caused the harm. 
Maybe we'll have more time to create a better system of response rather than the one that we 
have now, because we have, again, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of cops, and we 
still have so much sexual violence and so many homicides, and it's just an inadequate 
response to the harms of our nightmares.
And so that is why I'm excited about what abolitionists are fighting for. And I know it's going 
to take time to get there, but I think it's more than worth the pursuit.
Fabiola: So in thinking about getting there, is there a specific plan or roadmap for abolition? 
Like what is the relationship between abolition and time, like is abolition right now? Or is 
there like a future date that you're working toward or are the actions that we're doing today all 
considered part of the abolitionist dream. 
Derecka: I would say it's more than just a dream. I think that there are lots of things that are 
happening that can be considered abolitionist, right? So abolition is not just simply the 
eradication of the institution of policing or mass incarceration or the carceral state. It's also 
building up the kinds of people, neighborhoods, relationships, planet that we all deserve and 
that's always happening. Right. 
And so in terms of a timeline, there are different people who are fighting on different 
timelines for broader visions that lead towards an abolitionist future. So when I listen to 
climate justice activists fighting to stop emissions or fighting to stop the increase of earth's 
temperature by four degrees in the next 10 to like 30 years, that has abolitionist implications 
because the more that the planet heats up, the more there's going to be climate refugees, the 
more chaos there's going to be across borders. The more that governments are going to 
deploy police and the military to go be responsive to them. Right. So I will think of something 
like that as a very specific timeline that has abolitionist implications. 
And so when we think about abolitionists' relationship to lots of different struggles for 
justice, some of them do have concrete times. Others, it really depends. Do I think that I'm 
going to be alive to see the total eradication of the prison industrial complex? Absolutely not. 
I'm not going to be here. I, my children aren't going to be alive. You know, maybe my 
grandchildren, if we still have a planet by then. But what I hope is that I am doing what it 
takes right now, during my brief time on this planet to make sure that the foundation is being 
laid to make it easier for the next group of people who are fighting to reduce resources from 
the police, who are fighting to reduce our reliance on the police who are fighting to reduce 
the reasons why people think they need police. 
And everything I just listed — all of that's happening right now. And it's going to continue to 
happen over time. It's just about whether people are going to sabotage that by continuing to 
give money to the police.
Fabiola: Are there ever any moments when you feel like abolition just feels way too big, too 
daring for us to just imagine our liberation in that way and just demand it? 
Derecka: Yes and no. Interestingly, what used to at least feel so overwhelming to me, was 
fighting or stopping climate change. I was like, I don't know. I think we're too far gone. Like 
it's too late. 
But the more that I read, the more that I met climate justice activists, the more that I studied 
and struggled alongside them, I was like, oh yeah, we actually can do this. This can happen. 
When people say we need to abolish the police. I'm sure that makes you feel like, whoa, what 
are you talking about? That's what I used to feel about with climate change. And so it 
absolutely is going to feel overwhelming. 
I think what gives me a lot of inspiration is to know that there are so many movements in 
which the impossible seemed impossible, from the abolition of slavery to women's suffrage, 
to some of the demands and gains from the civil rights movement, you know, to the fight for 
the eight hour work day, the fight for social security, all of these struggles that we benefit 
from right now, they once seemed impossible. Right, there are abolitionists, insurrectionists 
who fought to end slavery who never got to be free, who never got to experience it.
And it is in their tradition and their legacy that I'm just like, wait, you know, I may not be able 
to see this, but it's so important for me to do what I need to do now, because that's the 
tradition that I come from. And that's where I learned. So there's that. 
The part where I am a bit curious or pessimistic, where I'm just wondering like, wow, is this 
going to manifest in the way that I hope it does is actually around white violence. 
I remember when Sandy Hook happened and a white gunman walked into an elementary 
school and killed white five and six year olds, and nothing radically changed about gun 
violence in this country. Like nothing. 
I was like, oh, y'all are pretending that this society is so progressive. Y'all are pretending that 
you really care about violence, that we need police to come and be first responders when 
these mass shootings happen. But you aren't committed to even saving white five and six 
year olds. Like what does that literally mean for everyone else? Not only in this country, but 
in this world. 
And so I have a deep sense of pessimism and anger towards the idea of the same people 
keeps telling us, we need to fund more police in order to be responsive to violence. Actually 
won't do anything courageous to stop the rampant gun culture in the United States. And that 
angers me.
Fabiola: Yeah, throughout this whole conversation, I've just been thinking about Dylann Roof. 
For me, when I think of, like, the most violence, I think about Dylann Roof. And I'm just like, 
wow, what kind of world should we be imagining right now, can we create, so that something 
or someone like a Dylann Roof, right, shooting up churchgoers. So that couldn't happen 
again, or just never happened? Like what kind of world could we live in? 
Do you have time for one more question, Derecka? And it's just a question about the future. 
Derecka: Yeah, of course.
 Fabiola: Awesome. So it's 200 years from now and we've achieved abolition. For me in you, 
black women. what are we able to do in the conclusion of your book? You talk about 
neighborhood councils, childcare. You talk about conflict resolution, health clinics, green 
teams. 
So what do we have access to 200 years from now? And what are we able to do? 
Derecka: Oh, wow. This is so good. This is so good. I've been thinking a lot about invisibility 
There's this, you know, like the social media thing about what it means to be seen and black 
women are not seen, and we celebrate and applaud black visibility and black mobility, but I'm 
actually very curious. About what invisibility will look like? Like what does it mean to not feel 
like a target or not to feel like you have to be tasked with breaking barriers, even within your 
family or outside your family? So I imagine, a world where black women in particular get to 
live very normal, exciting lives or mundane lives if they choose to. I imagine that they have 
new kinds of problems, right? That's the world that I'm ultimately fighting for. How do we get 
new kinds of problems? 
So many of my friends, they want to be partnered, young black women, you know, in their 
thirties, early forties, they want to be partnered. And I always tell them like, girl, you need to 
become an abolitionists because mass incarceration is disappearing, a million black men 
who you are attracted to. Right. And so it's so, so, so sad to know that it seems like many of 
our options have been stifled by misogyny, by patriarchy, by capitalism. 
So in that future, I imagine lots of options, different kinds of relationships. Intimate 
relationships, different kinds of friendships. I imagine black women being able to experience 
love that's not predicated on whether they'll be able to have health insurance, right, in a 
marriage or a house because their husband's making more than them. Or, I imagine a society 
where there's no private property and we get to experience lives based on, 
So for example, I think about Airbnb all the time. And how Airbnb, you know, it gentrifies 
communities, it displaces poor communities. And, you know, we have companies who are 
buying houses and flipping them just so they can be Airbnb. And I was like, wow, after the 
revolution, what are we going to do with all of these mansions? I want something where you 
don't have to rely on an income to experience beauty. Right. I want someone to experience 
what it feels like to wake up on a coast for a couple of weeks and watch the water hit the side 
of your window. I want everyone to be able to experience that. I want us to think about travel 
differently. If you want to go from New York City to Miami, you can take a high-speed train 
and get there in a couple of hours.
And once you get there, there's robust quality childcare for you to drop your kids off. Right? I 
want all of that and so much more, and I'm very jealous of the people who will be able to live 
in that kind of future.
Fabiola: wow. I'm very, very jealous of them as well. So jealous. I really just had a vision in 
mind of just all of that. 
Derecka: You saw the train. 
Fabiola: Yeah. I saw the 
Derecka: and you saw the train, right? You saw the mansions right. We all get to rotate. We 
all get to eat.
Fabiola: Derecka Purnell. Thank you so much for your time today. 
Derecka: Of course. Thank you so much for having me.
