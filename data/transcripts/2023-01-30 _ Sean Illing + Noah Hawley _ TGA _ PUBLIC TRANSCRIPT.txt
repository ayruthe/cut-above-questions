TITLE: The creator of Fargo is done with good guys vs. bad guys

SUBTITLE: Noah Hawley, novelist and showrunner of Fargo on FX, talks with Sean Illing 
about the enduring power of old American myths

DESCRIPTION:
Sean Illing talks with Noah Hawley, the creator and showrunner of the anthology drama 
Fargo on FX, as well as a celebrated novelist whose newest book is Anthem (2022). They 
discuss themes stemming from Hawley's recent piece in the Atlantic about myths, stories, 
and tropes from the Old West (and Hollywood) that are still powerful and active in shaping 
American society. Hawley also talks about why we're drawn to shows like Game of Thrones 
and The Walking Dead, what to expect on the forthcoming fifth season of Fargo, and what 
his new novel says about the future.

	INTRO:
	
[High Noon music]
	
Sean Illing: In the 1952 film High Noon, Gary Cooper plays Marshal Will Kane. And basically, 
the bad guys are coming back, and Will’s got to make a decision: should he leave town, like 
everyone else, or should he stay and uphold law and order?
	
[CLIP from High Noon:]
AMY: Oh Will, Will I’m begging you, please, let’s go.
WILL: I can’t.
AMY: Don’t try to be a hero. You don’t have to be a hero, not for me.
WILL: I’m not trying to be a hero. If you think I like this, you’re crazy. I have to stay.
	
It’s maybe the clearest example of what we call the “reluctant hero” — an unquestionably good, 
upright, moral individual … a man, usually; thanks, Hollywood … who sticks around to solve the 
problem of evil, who’s duty-bound, to put his life on the line and have some… big showdown.
	
[gunshot noise; music out]
	
There’s a problem with this story, though… this is almost never how things work in real life. 
Actual justice rarely culminates in some kind of good guy vs. bad guy standoff. But hey… it’s a 
great story, isn’t it? 
	
We talk about a lot of things on this show, but we often come back to the power of stories, and 
how this power relates to our social and political dysfunction. Usually we’re having these 
conversations with scholars, or other public intellectual types. 
	
But what about artists, making work that tries to capture the problems of our present moment?
	
ID: I’m Sean Illing, and this… is the Gray Area.

My guest today is Noah Hawley. He’s a TV and film director and showrunner, and he’s the 
creator of one of my favorite TV shows: Fargo, the anthology drama loosely based on the 1996 
Coen Brothers film. He’s also a novelist, and his newest book Anthem came out last year to 
critical acclaim. 

But Hawley got my attention because of a recent piece he wrote for the Atlantic, called “It’s High 
Noon in America.” 

Hawley argues that these Old West myths, like the reluctant hero, are still very powerful in 
American life. And all the lawlessness and violence they glorify, that stuff seeps into our culture. 
Which is why he thinks we can learn a lot by looking at what stories are most popular.

Noah Hawley: I feel like this line between politics and culture has really become so gray, you 
know, that everything is politics now that it becomes a psychological issue for us, where we 
can't really separate anymore what is our day-to-day life from the politics around us. 
Because I want to tell stories for everyone. I live in the middle of the country. I grew up in New 
York City. I've worked in Los Angeles, I've lived in San Francisco. I think there's value to living in 
the middle of the country, but you know, it gets harder and harder to reach everyone.
You kind of have to choose your platform, and those platforms have become self-sorting in a 
way. But the other thing is it's very hard to tell stories that don't suddenly feel political. So 
whether you watch Yellowstone or whether you watch Fargo, it feels like looking at the world in 
two different ways.
Sean Illing: Well, speaking of stories, there is a lot going on in your new novel Anthem. Is that 
your, your sixth or your fifth.
Noah: Sixth.
Sean: Okay. You know, I think we both love Kurt Vonnegut, especially Slaughterhouse-Five, 
and this book of yours, like Slaughterhouse-Five, really does kind of feel like someone trying to 
wrestle with a broken world or trying to wrestle with a broken moral order, if that makes any 
sense.
I mean, is that even close to how you think of it, or am I just an idiot?
Noah: No, I think you're not an idiot. I think you're right on it.
Sean: Sweet.
Noah: You know, to tell a story that tries to look at the world that we live in right now. Right? 
How do you write about the world that we live in, especially in these last four years in a way 
that's going to even be relevant in that moment. But I did feel it was important to put myself in 
the book for the first time as sort of narrator, because I'm trying to think about the issues we're 
wrestling with in this world. And I think it's important to be a character in my own story, to 
address that. To say, look, I'm worried; you are worried. Let me try to create a fictional story of 
our world to see if I got it right. 
And so the challenge of finding a model for that brought me to Vonnegut and to 
Slaughterhouse-Five. You know, his story of his World War II experience, fictionalized, in which 
it's a story about a man who has come unstuck in time. It's a cross-genre book. It should not 
work. When you look at all the elements of it on paper, it should not work, but it does very much.
Sean: Yeah, I mean even the, your decision to sort of break the fourth wall and kind of, like, talk 
directly to the reader, felt like you saying I've got some shit that I wanna say and I'm just gonna 
say it. [laff]
Noah: Right, but I made a very deliberate choice never to use the word Democrat or 
Republican, to try to simply describe things the way that I saw them without the names for them. 
So there's a lot of descriptions of one political party versus another political party. It's the 
swimmers versus the surfers, or it's the restaurant versus the bar, you know, in which the 
restaurant is the party where…
Come in everyone and we'll feed you and there's a seat for everyone. But at the same time, we 
also feel like you should be paying the bills for the people who can't afford to eat there, versus 
the bar, which is now a sports bar, which is, you're on our team, or you're not on our team. In a 
kind of literate onomatopoetic sense of like, well, what is the thing really without the name?
Sean: You know, we're both parents. I mean, I have one son who's only three and a half. How 
many– do you have two?
Noah: I have two. Yeah. I have a daughter who's 15 and a son who's 10.
Sean: Okay. You know, a big part of this story you're telling is told from the perspective of 
teenagers. Why was that important given what you were trying to do in the book?
Noah: Well, I think there's a really interesting challenge that we're facing right now, which is: 
how do you prepare your children to live in a world in which reality itself is up for debate? It's not 
something you and I had to learn when we went out into the world or our parents' generation or 
any other American generation before, really.
But we are at this moment where, which reality you believe in depends very much on which 
political party you're associated with. And so, how do I raise a son or a daughter and send them 
out into the world? How do they navigate that problem of what's real and what's not real? 
And so I wanted in the story to take these late teens, early teens, to send them out into this 
world, having left an anxiety center, a kind of private psych hospital for teenagers, to go out and 
try to go on a quest, really, because the structure of the book became very rooted in the fantasy 
novel. 
It was an adventure novel, and that allowed me to say that the fantasy world that they're 
exploring is ours. It's either a, a fantasy novel about the real world we live in, or a real novel 
about the fantasy world we live in.
Sean: Yeah, I love that line. But it is such a rich vein to tap. This question of like, what it feels 
like to be a young person, in a very anxious world that feels like it is, you know, blowing apart, 
where it feels like, you know, the old people have mucked it up yet again, and maybe it's always 
feels like that [laff] but it, it really does feel like that now.
Noah: I think that climate change has really escalated this, you know, climate change combined 
with the fact that everyone in charge of our government is over 70. I have this feeling like, every 
Fortune 500 board of directors should have at least one 12 year old on it right now. 
We need to be moving toward this handoff to the next generation a lot faster than we normally 
do because that's who's going to be living with the problems that we've made.
Sean: That line about it being either a fantasy novel about the real world we live in and 
somehow a realistic novel about the fantasy world we live in. I mean, beyond just being a, a hell 
of a line. How can it be both of those things at the same time? I think it is, but it's strange.
Noah: It is strange, I think that there is on some level a sense of reality shock that occurred in 
2016 that we have not really recovered from. If you think back to the Pizzagate moment where 
this man went into a pizza restaurant in DC, and shot it up, he's looking for the dungeon where 
the Democrats are keeping the children.
And there is no dungeon. And he's arrested. And what is that moment for somebody to realize 
that you've literally put yourself into prison chasing a reality that doesn't exist, that's a fantasy? 
And to make it stranger, right, what happens immediately the next day is that Alex Jones gets 
on the radio and says that this man is a false flag actor.
He's part of the fantasy, right? So, if you're that guy in prison, suddenly you're part of the 
fantasy, not part of the reality anymore. These are very strange moments and you know, I 
explored it a bit in the third year of Fargo, this idea that there's violence to realizing that the 
world you're living in isn't what you thought it was.
There's this mental trauma that people suffer from. And I think we're still trying to find our way 
back to where we were before, but I don't think there is a before anymore. We just have to 
figure out what's on the other side of it.
Sean: Do you think we need new stories? 
Noah: Well, I think what's interesting is we have to figure out how to talk to each other, how to 
tell stories that resonate with people despite the opinions they hold. We're ending up in a world 
where the only stories that really resonate with people are the unchallenging stories. There's a 
reason that Avatar is successful, or, or Marvel movies are successful.
Those old brands can bypass this current quagmire that we're in. But I do feel like, and I wrote 
about this in The Atlantic, we are sort of hostage now to these American myths in our 
entertainment without even really realizing it. The myth of the reluctant hero or you know, the 
myth of frontier justice. All of these ideas that have come back in terms of the way that both 
sides are really seeing the world. 
All the energy that Democrats are spending, trying to understand the Republican mindset, and 
the conspiratorial mindset, et cetera, is not being reciprocated on the other side. You are not 
seeing a lot of analysis on Fox News or in conservative publications about why Democrats 
believe what they believe.
What is the underlying basis. They're not doing socioeconomic studies to try to understand the 
mindset of economically challenged white voters, et cetera. Right? It's a very uneven balance. 
One side is really trying to understand where the other side is coming from, and then the other 
side is just projecting onto the first side.
So, it is very strange because we obviously, we wanna understand. My job as a fiction writer 
and a creator of characters — all I'm doing is trying to recreate the world I live in to see if I can 
understand it. And so it does become fascinating to see that there are people who are burning 
thousands of hours of their lives trying to understand where people who don't agree with them 
are coming from.
And then a whole other segment of the population that could on some level care less.
Sean: In that piece, you described Fargo, and it was so interesting to read that piece as, as 
someone who've, I've watched all of the seasons of Fargo and I have lots of thoughts about it. 
It’s one of my favorite shows ever. But you describe it as a tragedy based on an inability to 
communicate, and said that that is actually also a good way to describe the current American 
predicament.
And now I'm quoting you, right? You say we have two sides that both feel aggrieved, each 
believes that their own pain is real and that the others’ is a fantasy. I mean, is that another way 
of saying that both sides are trapped in misleading stories about each other?
Noah: Well, I think it's very important to understand that we're not talking about villains here. 
We're talking about people, and that people find their way to beliefs and a way of looking at life 
in the same way. They just don't always end up in the same place. If you think about the movie 
Fargo, Bill Macy, Jerry Lundegaard… This whole thing could have been avoided if he had just 
said, I fucked up.
And I had my wife kidnapped, and I made a huge mistake. But he can't admit the truth out loud, 
and in fact he can't even admit it to himself. And so much of Fargo is about the state of denial 
that characters are in, in which they can't admit what they've done or what is happening, and so 
much death and destruction comes out of that inability to communicate.
And so that's the tragedy of it, right? Tragedy being a bad ending that was avoidable if different 
choices had been made.
Sean: That's funny. I always think of tragedy as just like a collision of terrible options, where 
resolution is simply not in the cards.
Noah: Right.  I see it differently. I see. I see the path to not tragedy is very clear and you just 
choose to go in the tragic direction.

Why does Noah Hawley think that it’s high noon in America? That’s 
what I’ll ask him, after a quick break.

 

MIDROLL 1

music

Sean: In that Atlantic piece, you, you know, you're writing about a very particular species of 
violence animated by a very American way of thinking. What do you mean when you say that 
it's high noon in America?
Noah: Well, this idea of high noon is a myth
Sean: Right.
Noah: that the way the world actually works is… rarely is it white hat versus black hat in the 
town square at noon. The reality of life, as in Fargo, is that it's a lot of elements on a collision 
course and you never know which ones are gonna collide and when. 
But we are searching always for high noon because we've been trained to feel like that's the 
most satisfying resolution, right? Not just that the guy with the white hat is gonna face the guy 
with the black hat, but that one of them is gonna kill the other one. That is the most satisfying 
version of a story for a lot of people.
Sean: Why do you think we love that so much here? Why do you think we love that reluctant 
hero myth, right? This idea that ,like, there's this good man just trying to live his life in solitude 
and peace and he is forced by dint of circumstances to like rise up and you know, take down 
this villain or this evil or whatever.
What is it about that that appeals so deeply to us?
Noah: I think it allows our heroes to be good people, even though they might end up doing 
something that is immoral at the end of the day. 
I talked very much when I sold the idea of making Fargo that it was about the people that we 
yearn to be, decent and kind, versus the people we fear the most. 
Sean: Yeah.
Noah: But that it's like, you know, the myth of World War II where all these peaceful men put 
down their plowshares and picked up rifles to go to fight Hitler. And then when they came back, 
you know, they melted their rifles and they picked up their plowshares and all they wanted was 
to go back to being peaceful men. Right? 
I think there's a very romantic sense of that. I think it gets confusing this idea — and we flirted 
with it in the late nineties and the early 2000s, all the anti-heroes that flooded our TV screens 
and our films, you know, the reluctant demon hunters who were out there, and they couldn't be 
happy, they had to be tortured so that we could sleep at night.
And you know, I think there was something very meaningful about that, transformatively in our 
culture, that really played into a romantic sense that you feel on the right, which is like, this is 
the world. The world is the zombie apocalypse. The world is this ugly place where your neighbor 
would just as likely kill you as help you.
So we have to be armed, we have to be ready. 
Sean: Yeah.
Noah: And do you ever wonder why they put Donald Trump's head on Rambo's body? Like, 
why Rambo? Except that he was just this Vietnam vet who had come back and he just wanted 
to settle back in and live a life. But the cops hassled him and they wouldn't leave him alone.
And so he ended up having to destroy the system that was persecuting him.
Sean: I'm, I mean, I'm vaguely aware of these sort of cultural myths and how they appear in 
various stories, but the way you connect them with the current pop culture is very interesting to 
me. You know, I hadn't heard anyone, or read anyone until I read your piece, draw this 
comparison between The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones.
Two shows that I have watched. And you point out how these two shows are… not just different. 
They offer different and really competing visions of human nature and political virtue. Can you 
say a bit about that distinction ‘cause it is quite useful.
Noah: Yeah, I mean that — what I noticed about zombie movies is that the real enemy is 
always other people. The zombies are just a backdrop against which society breaks down. And 
when you watch The Walking Dead, you have your core of heroes, right? And some of them are 
traitors and will ultimately betray you.
But then it's always about running into that other group of people and those other group of 
people have either decided that they have to control you or destroy you or use you as bait, et 
cetera, et cetera. The zombie apocalypse films are rarely a kumbaya story of humanity coming 
together to fight this larger evil, right?
And Game of Thrones flirted with this idea, right? That everything was politics and, you know, 
everyone was competing for the throne and it was a zero sum game. But then in the end, when 
they saw the zombies, they were like, Okay, we can put aside our differences and go and face 
this threat. And, where these two shows were popular in America, I think the New York Times 
map mapped it out and, and it, it lines up with very different segments of our population.
The Walking Dead is, has been historically been very popular in the South and in more rural 
areas, and Game of Thrones is a more coastal elitist show for people to watch. And some of 
that of course is that HBO costs money, and AMC didn't cost money. But I think some of it is 
also… it's just a worldview.
Sean: I just have never thought of The Walking Dead as a conservative show. Not conservative 
in the sense of like Republican, I mean conservative on like a very deep level. Like as anchored 
in this view of the world that basically says, yeah, when the veneer of civilization slips away, 
your neighbor will absolutely kill you for a can of tuna… or for a gallon of gas.
And part of me is attracted to that view, if I'm being honest. And part of me is repelled by it, 
too… but I don't think it's entirely wrong. 
You know.. I remember post-Katrina New Orleans — I was living in Louisiana when that 
happened.
And you know, part of me agrees with the Joker in The Dark Knight, that when the chips are 
down, people will eat each other. And part of me thinks… well, that might be true, but that's not 
the whole story of humanity. And obsessing over the worst parts of us is a very good way to 
bring about those worst parts of us. Does that make sense?
Noah: Well, and I think that, I think that, that, that's true for most people. Most people are not in 
this camp of believing that your fellow man will turn on you at the drop of a dime. I think what 
gets troublesome is when the attraction of that myth gets tied up with a political worldview and, 
and tied to a larger political party that has a lot of moderation built into it.
I mean, this idea of being a conservative was usually based on an idea of moderation. But now 
as the party is taken over by more radical elements, this worldview begins to seep into the more 
conservative, the more moderate elements until this dog eat dog worldview becomes, on some 
level, the only platform of the party.
Sean: Do you think, if you had those two shows, Walking Dead in Game of Thrones? If you had 
these two competing shows in parallel 10 years ago, do you think the popularity would've kind of 
mapped that neatly onto our partisan divisions, or do you think that really is a function of just 
where we're at right now in this moment?
Noah: Well, you know, they're not polar opposite shows. If you remember, Game of Thrones 
had a real gender violence problem, and it was on many levels a very male fantasy of how 
power works in the world. So on some levels, the two shows kind of overlap in certain areas.
But, it's just in the way they resolved, right? Which was in a Game of Thrones they decided that, 
stronger together. They adopted a kind of liberal myth of a rising tide lifts all boats. 
I think on some level, these myths have always been more loaded than just entertainment.
But I think they used to be more entertainment than staking a position. You know, the popularity 
of Yellowstone right now as a kind of team jersey, of who's watching it and who's not watching 
it, and what it means to people, in terms of Yellowstone, the idea that this man, this rancher who 
owns hundreds of thousands of acres is the best steward of the land. That the native tribe wants 
the land back, but even they have to admit that John Dutton is the best steward of this land.
And in the show, this Dutton family will literally kill anyone who challenges their ownership of the 
land. And that's a heroic quality as presented on the show. You know, and it's a very different 
way of looking at the world than a lot of other shows present.
Sean: And how does a show like Fargo [laff] sort of slot into these mythical boxes or in some 
ways float above it? You know, I always thought — it always felt like a very dark, very 
existentialist show that is actually full of commentary if you're listening, but it never seemed to 
be celebrating anything in the way that some of these other shows — or glorifying some of 
these things in the way these other shows we’re talking about do.
Noah: Well, I mean, the lessons that I took fro the movie Fargo and from Joel and Ethan's work 
is that violence should never be entertainment. When you think about the violence in the movie 
Fargo, it's always really shocking. It happens quickly. It's very graphic. The state trooper gets 
shot in the head and the amount of blood that comes out leaves the viewer like Steve Buscemi 
going, “Whoa, daddy.” 
So what's interesting to me always is, we're so trained to want High Noon. We're so trained to 
feel like violence is story and action and resolves things.
And, and I always like to walk viewers up to a line, and then there's a certain moment in which 
you go, Oh, I don't like this. I wanted this, but now it's here and I don't want it. You know what I 
mean? And for me, there's never a really a white hat versus black hat moment on the show.
Sean: And that's why I love it, I think. Because it blurs the lines in those ways. And, we love the 
idea of the good guy and the bad guy, and we love the idea tangentially of the vigilante, right?
It's why we love Batman, and we love the idea that some things are so bad that you, it requires 
the reluctant hero to step outside the law, to step outside the norms and do what has to be done 
in the name of preserving freedom or liberty or whatever.
Noah: Well for me, the show was always the story of decency versus evil. Not good versus evil, 
but decency, basic decency. The idea that, when left to their own devices, most Americans, they 
just want their family to be okay. They just want to do the right thing. And sometimes forces will 
rise up that are a true threat and have to be dealt with. But one never takes joy in it. And it's 
never easy. 
And the hope, like at the end of the film, when Marge has seen the most, the worst case she'll 
ever see, and she's got two months till the baby's born and her husband got the 3 cent stamp, 
and tomorrow is gonna be just another day.
And that's her reward. We want to go back to safety and security, and the challenge that I'm 
exploring in this next season, right, is this idea of “Minnesota nice.” Which is the sort of comic 
underpinnings of Fargo, Which is a, is polite society, places in which people are so… in the sort 
of Lutheran way, they don't wanna offend anyone.
They won't say something out loud that might offend anyone. And you end up with a very 
passive aggressive civilization. But then, you look at the school board meetings right now, right? 
And there's nothing passive about it, right? So, once the Minnesota nice goes away, what's left 
in Minnesota?
And yet at the end of the day, people just care about their kids, right? And whether they've 
come to believe that vaccines are evil or, teaching kids about racism is harming their children… 
at the end of the day, it's not that they're evil people, they just care about their kids and this is 
the way they think they can protect their kids.
Sean: Lots of people have always believed lots of ridiculous things like Pizzagate, but the 
internet is such a game changer in terms of our ability to curate our reality, and maybe in some 
bizarre way it has amplified the power of these stories.
About frontier justice or civilizational threats and made them more ridiculous in the process. I 
mean [laff], even our coups now are mostly just idiots live streaming their cosplay adventures. 
But that fact almost makes it more worrisome because it speaks to this inexorable journey from 
fantasizing about violence to doing violence and how that line is very weirdly blurred at the 
moment 
Noah: Well, you know, I make a point in the book to say that the book is not satire. Satire used 
to be a very effective way to police bad behavior in our society because you would mock 
someone who is doing wrong and they would feel shame. 
But we live in this inverted reality moment in which the things that people used to feel ashamed 
about, they're now very proud of. And so we've reached this moment of absurdity in terms of 
members of Congress, for example, who are under investigation for trafficking minors across 
[laff] state lines, who are standing at a platform talking about moral high ground. 
And it used to be that you could shame people like that, but they don't feel shame anymore. 
I started thinking in the third year of Fargo about this idea that irony without humor is just 
violence. If you think about, if you think about Kafka, right? A man is put on trial for a crime that 
he will never know what they're accusing him of.
And it's absurd, but it's not funny. And so what it is is just violent. It does violence to your mind 
to try to resolve that. We've hit that moment in which, you know, there's always a moment in 
Fargo where the worst person in the show says, I'm the victim here. And then that has now 
become our reality where you hear a lot of men claiming to be victims in our society who have 
been victimized in no way, who still have all the power and the ability to dictate the 
conversation. And yet they could not be screaming louder about their own victimization.
Sean: This question of men and, I'm glad you went there. You take it on in the piece. There's 
just no question that something that is happening right now is that young men in particular are 
being radicalized, as you put it, by the closed information loop of internet America.
This is something I think a lot about, and you wrote something that really captured my attention 
and, uh, I'll just quote you. You say, this is how it is with a certain type of American male. They 
start with Nietzsche, they end with carnage. 
I'll just ask you what you, what you meant by that and, and we can riff on it a little bit.
Noah: Well, you know, someone once said, it's hard to be useful and sad. Like, that act of 
helping others, when you look at a society and and what actually makes people feel good about 
themselves, it's not helping themselves, it's helping other people.
But I think we're always struggling with what our young people can be doing. You know, in 
different regions of the world, the less that young men specifically have to occupy themselves, 
the more trouble they get into.
Sean: Yep.
Noah: And, I went to the dermatologist the other day and, you know, I told him that I'd started 
taking testosterone cause my testosterone was low. And he was like, oh, do you listen to Joe 
Rogan? Because apparently Joe is just telling every man in his twenties to take testosterone.
Which is not what young men need — more testosterone. 
Sean: Good lord.
Noah: But the problem is that if you don't have enough to do with yourself and a sense of 
purpose, then you get into trouble because this is the age, you know, people in their twenties, 
this is when you're most passionate.
Right? That's why we had the Civil Rights movement, and the sixties, the youth culture revolt, et 
cetera, you know, and then in the late nineties we had the dot-com revolution. You know, it was 
something for young people to get really passionate about. 
And, there's just been this really fascinating inversion of passion and co-option of language, of 
what used to be the left by the right in terms of my body, my choice, which is now about 
vaccines, and, you know, in Russia they had free and fair elections and a free and fair election 
in the Soviet Union was you show up, they hand you a ballot that's already been filled out, and 
you put it in the box and you have voted. And they called that a free and fair election.
And part of why they called it that is so that when you tried to have a revolution and change it, 
what were you gonna call it? The name had already been co-opted, the words we had to say 
free and fair meant the exact opposite. So what words could you use? You know? 
And so that's where we get back to this: irony without humor is just violence, right? It boggles 
the mind. It, it shuts the mind down on some level, which I think is the point.
Sean: It's a really bad idea to read Nietzsche if you’re drunk on this, on a cocktail of delusion 
and resentment because you know, It's not an accident that he's so appealing to young men in 
particular. Right? I mean, he's subversive and brilliant and kind of punk rock.
You read him and he tells you that all the pieties [laff] that the masses swallow uncritically are 
just bullshit constructs. And that most of what we call morality is really just an attempt to stifle 
the strong, creative individual. 
Noah: Right.
Sean: And of course he's very interesting, right? But the problem is that young men read him 
and think they're the powerful individual being restrained by society.
And when you're young and impressionable, you long for that sense of mission and higher 
purpose. You wanna float above the herd, to use his language, and Nietzsche speaks directly to 
those fantasies. And if the line between fantasy and reality is already blurred in your mind, that's 
a very dangerous place to be.
Noah: You know, I remember talking to, to Chris McQuarrie, who is making the Mission 
Impossible movies where Paramount, which is the studio was saying, we need to get more 
young men watching these movies. And Chris was like, well, young men want John Wick.
That's what young men want. So, if that's the audience you want to get, then you have to really 
increase the graphicness of the violence and the intensity of the violence in these movies. And 
of course that's not true for all young men. I was a young man once. You were a young man 
once. I wasn't John Wick crazy.
But it is worth thinking about the fact that there is this testosterone of youth that wants 
confrontation, that wants violence, and sometimes it's, you know, the joy of intellectual combat 
as well, but there is an attraction to white hat versus black hat in the town square, that, as you 
get older and you realize that life is more complicated than that, maybe you're more open to 
stories that resolve less concretely. 
But, if you're not occupied enough and you're looking for stories that give you big feelings, which 
is what you want as a young person, those are the stories that are working.
Sean: One thing that's just so clear to me, you know, look, young men are always gonna be a 
challenge for society. They just will be.
And it's, it is a weird, awkward thing, figuring out what the hell it means to be a man or how to 
define your manhood. And young men in particular will always do incredibly stupid and 
dangerous things. But if our culture doesn’t provide rites of passages or if it's dysfunctional, if 
we don't have healthy ways to express masculinity, if we don't have healthy models of 
masculinity, if we lack social infrastructure for young boys, uh, if we just don't have anything 
productive to do, we're gonna have the big problem.
And obviously, the funhouse mirror that is the internet, and the orgy of grievances that that 
unleashes, boy, that's um, that makes things even worse.
Noah: Well, you know, I, I came of age in the seventies, in the height of second wave feminism, 
and my mother was a feminist writer in New York City in the seventies. And I was very aware 
when I reached sexual maturity that I had come of age both as a sexual person and as a 
potential sexual predator.
Right? Like that this was… this was one version of what a man is, right, is that there's always 
the potential for violence that women feel from men. And so as a man with a feminist mother, I 
had to be able to hold those two ideas at the same time, which was, I have to be careful with the 
power that I have and not abuse it.
And I think the complexity of that is something that, if you face it, makes you a richer person. 
But what we're seeing now is a large rejection of any culpability or potential culpability, or even 
the idea of culpability, right? The idea that someone who is male is privileging from the very fact 
of their gender. And if you're not able to even entertain the notion of blame on yourself, then 
what you end up with is you have to fight harder and harder. 
I think we all thought when the internet was born that it would be a place in which everyone 
would feel comfortable saying their truths out loud. But what we realized was that there are a lot 
of people whose truths are very uncomfortable for the people who are used to being heard in 
our society. And so you had a lot of people who suddenly were like, well, I don't want to hear 
that.
That makes me feel bad about myself. And we have to be able to feel bad about ourselves. It's 
okay. Like, I'm a grownup. I can have that feeling. As Molly Ivins said once, it's like, I can 
disagree with people and not hate them because I'm an adult.

We’ve got to take one last quick break, but when we come back, I’ll 
ask Noah about the new vision of justice that he’s said will be 
featured on the upcoming fifth season of Fargo.

 

MIDROLL 2

music

Sean: I was intrigued when you wrote in your piece that on the next season of Fargo, you're 
going to champion a different vision of justice. Right? A more collective vision of justice, you 
write.
One that doesn't just romanticize or lionize the reluctant hero. What’s your thinking behind that?

Noah: Yeah, I mean, I think it's important to try to tell stories right now that champion the 
system of justice, the idea of justice as a group effort, in which we come together as society and 
we make laws and we enforce these laws, and not this reluctant hero version, which I have 
done myself.
Knowingly or unknowingly, in three of the four seasons so far, I have had a police officer 
character who is at odds with his or her boss, where the system of justice is either corrupt or 
incompetent. And this reluctant hero is going to solve the case no matter what gets in their way, 
right? And it's a very romantic notion, and I think we appreciate the simplicity of it. There's a 
hero and they're gonna do the right thing. 
But, that's not really how our system works. Our justice system works like, a case is brought, 
and it's a cooperation between many facets of our law enforcement, and prosecutors and 
judges and et cetera.
And it doesn't work very well much of the time. But when it does work well, it is the best form of 
justice there is because it is not emotional. 
And I think to tell a story in which the system of justice wins in the end, in this moment in which 
our system of justice is under such attack in which there's literally now a Congressional 
committee on the weaponization of the government, by which they mean investigating people 
who are believed to have committed crimes.
Again, you know, “free and fair elections” and the corruption of language. I mean, for all of our 
conversations about our current attorney general and why doesn't he move faster, et cetera, 
and why is he so deliberate and is it a good thing or a bad thing? He believes in the system of 
justice and he's trying to make it work so that no one can complain, which of course is 
impossible because, people gonna complain.
But at the end of the day, if the system of justice checks every box and justice is done, then the 
outcome is defendable and history will reflect that.
Sean: Does trying to tell a story like that right now feel like an attempt to conquer your own 
cynicism, or is it coming from a place of genuine hopefulness.
Noah: I don't know that, that it's that your two options are cynicism or hopefulness. I mean, I, I 
think all I'm trying to do is, kind of hold the society that I was raised in to its principles.
And do I hope that in real life it will do that? Well, I'm telling a fictionalized story, so, I would 
hope that in real life, it would do it. In a fictionalized story, I can do it, but I also can't make it 
white hat, black hat. It has to be complicated because, it is always complicated and it's still a 
tragedy, right? Even when it happens, it's still a tragedy, because a crime was committed.
Sean: Yeah. But even that piece, you know, it, it ends on a very somber, sobering note. You 
know, you're describing your, your efforts to answer your son's question about, what the hell are 
we gonna do about all these mass shootings? 
And, your answer isn't necessarily wrong, but it is bleak [laff] you know, and you just, you close 
it by saying, well, we're gonna buy more guns.
Noah: Yes.
Well, what's interesting in this idea of frontier justice, which is another name for is vigilante 
justice that we've kind of — are getting back to, and that's what on some level January 6th was 
about, which is the sense that that, nobody can really tell us that what's right and what's wrong. 
We all know in our heart what is right and what is wrong. It's the emphasis on right and wrong 
versus legal and illegal. 
And if you believe that, you know, your morals, your beliefs are that the world is an inherently 
violent place, that you need weapons in order to protect yourself in this place, that the people 
who are telling you to disarm are fundamentally delusional about the way the world actually is, 
then at a certain point, this belief in frontier justice is a self-fulfilling prophecy, right? 
Because you are on a collision course with the law. And so, if the choice is either to be a 
criminal in this reality or to bring about frontier justice so that you are not a criminal, then the 
choice seems to be clear. it’s like, I don't want to be a criminal in this world in which the sheep 
are telling me that there is no wolf. Then you might begin to believe that the sheep is actually 
the wolf. And you have to defend yourself. 
And, you know, I say in the piece, it's like you have 40% of the country that believes the zombie 
apocalypse is already here, but the people they’re aiming their guns out are the other 60% of 
society who are just trying to understand like, well, what are you talking about?
Like, we're all just here. We could all figure this out the way we have for the last couple hundred 
years of, like, not everyone's happy all the time, but we figure out what the middle ground is and 
apparently there's no middle ground left.
Sean: I mean, not only that, there's just no shared reality left. I mean, even the disclaimer, you 
know, in the beginning of Fargo, right — “This is a true story” is its own kind of deconstruction of 
the idea of a [laff], of a true story, you know, which hits especially, uh, hard in this moment.
Noah: What's fascinating to me is like all of the conversations I have with the legal department 
at MGM or at FX about what I can say and not say, and show and not show and, products 
licensed or not licensed, no one has ever said to me, “You cannot say this is a true story ‘cause 
it's not a true story.”
Like they've never said that to me. And on some level, I guess it's ‘cause the movie said that. 
But it is crazy that we announce to the world that this made up story is true and no one argues, 
no one's trying to say that it's not.
Sean: Do you think there are any unifying stories left in our culture? One of the most depressing 
realizations for me, in the last several years, was that, it really does seem to me that nothing, 
quite literally nothing, including a once in a century pandemic, there is nothing that can't 
immediately get subsumed by this ongoing culture war.
And if that's the case, then I don't really know where to go…
Noah: Yeah. 
Sean: …from there. And I don't really know what kind of stories we could tell that would 
resonate with the entire country because the country is inhabiting very different spheres.
Noah: What I learned early on is that audiences react emotionally and instinctually to stories. 
And, there's some very clear things that audiences want. They want relationships to work out. 
They want families to stay together. They want the good guy to win in the end.
We love the idea of redemption. So, none of those things have changed for us. I think what's 
interesting is this idea of what happened to Jesus. Right. Jesus used to be, turn the other 
cheek, do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
And now for a large part of our society, Jesus is Warrior Jesus. Jesus is kick-ass-and-take-
names Jesus. Jesus isn't forgiving anybody. And, what's fascinating about that is what one has 
to do to continue to say that you believe in Jesus and what Jesus stood for, you have to change 
what Jesus stood for in order to do what you want to do, if it's not turn the other cheek and 
forgive. 
It's sort of been a fascinating to watch as a storyteller, this sense that there's a lot of people out 
there yelling about the threats to Christianity, but it feels like the definition has changed of 
what's being defended. 
And you know, I believe as a storyteller that we live on a religious planet. By far, the majority of 
people on this earth believe in God in one form or another. And so if you're telling a story that 
doesn't have religion in it, you're not talking about people, but I do feel a little bit caught out that, 
that what they're praying for at the dinner table is still all the old, do unto other which sort of 
feels like, you know, outta step with the current moment.
Sean: Yeah. I mean, it says a lot about how, it's not the stories so much that matter. It’s when 
and where we're reading them because we're always projecting.
Noah: Right.
Sean:  If we're taking our Jesus a la carte, then what… why can't we take everything else that 
way?
Noah: Well, it's, you know, if, if everything is in flux, then everything is in flux, right? What are 
we steering by? What are we grounding ourselves with? I mean, I set out in writing Anthem, I 
ended up writing a book about this moment in America because the question of like, well, wait a 
minute, what is that? became so loud, that it threatened to dwarf the story. 
Sean: Yeah. this has been a real treat, Noah. I, I really appreciate you doing it. Your new novel 
is terrific and if, if anyone is listening who has not watched any of the Fargo seasons yet, I 
cannot recommend them highly enough.
You should check them out. Noah Hawley, thanks for being here.
Noah: Thank you.
