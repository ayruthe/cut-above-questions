        "\tINTRO: \t\tIn the 1952 film High Noon, Gary Cooper plays Marshal Will Kane. And basically,  the bad guys are coming back, and Will’s got to make a decision: should he leave town, like everyone else, or should he stay and uphold law and order?\tAMY: Oh Will, Will I’m begging you, please, let’s go.WILL: I can’t.AMY: Don’t try to be a hero. You don’t have to be a hero, not for me.WILL: I’m not trying to be a hero. If you think I like this, you’re crazy. I have to stay.\tIt’s maybe the clearest example of what we call the “reluctant hero” — an unquestionably good, upright, moral individual … a man, usually; thanks, Hollywood … who sticks around to solve the problem of evil, who’s duty-bound, to put his life on the line and have some… big showdown.\t\tThere’s a problem with this story, though… this is almost never how things work in real life. Actual justice rarely culminates in some kind of good guy vs. bad guy standoff. But hey… it’s a great story, isn’t it? \tWe talk about a lot of things on this show, but we often come back to the power of stories, and how this power relates to our social and political dysfunction. Usually we’re having these conversations with scholars, or other public intellectual types. \tBut what about artists, making work that tries to capture the problems of our present moment?\tID: I’m Sean Illing, and this… is the Gray Area.My guest today is Noah Hawley. He’s a TV and film director and showrunner, and he’s the creator of one of my favorite TV shows: Fargo, the anthology drama loosely based on the 1996 Coen Brothers film. He’s also a novelist, and his newest book Anthem came out last year to critical acclaim. But Hawley got my attention because of a recent piece he wrote for the Atlantic, called “It’s High Noon in America.” Hawley argues that these Old West myths, like the reluctant hero, are still very powerful in American life. And all the lawlessness and violence they glorify, that stuff seeps into our culture. Which is why he thinks we can learn a lot by looking at what stories are most popular.",
        "Well, speaking of stories, there is a lot going on in your new novel Anthem. Is that  your, your sixth or your fifth.",
        "Sean: Okay. You know, I think we both love Kurt Vonnegut, especially Slaughterhouse-Five,  and this book of yours, like Slaughterhouse-Five, really does kind of feel like someone trying to wrestle with a broken world or trying to wrestle with a broken moral order, if that makes any sense.I mean, is that even close to how you think of it, or am I just an idiot?",
        "Sean: Sweet. ",
        "Sean: Yeah, I mean even the, your decision to sort of break the fourth wall and kind of, like, talk  directly to the reader, felt like you saying I've got some shit that I wanna say and I'm just gonna ",
        "Sean: You know, we're both parents. I mean, I have one son who's only three and a half. How  many– do you have two?",
        "Sean: Okay. You know, a big part of this story you're telling is told from the perspective of  teenagers. Why was that important given what you were trying to do in the book?",
        "Sean: Yeah, I love that line. But it is such a rich vein to tap. This question of like, what it feels  like to be a young person, in a very anxious world that feels like it is, you know, blowing apart, where it feels like, you know, the old people have mucked it up yet again, and maybe it's always ",
        "Sean: That line about it being either a fantasy novel about the real world we live in and  somehow a realistic novel about the fantasy world we live in. I mean, beyond just being a, a hell of a line. How can it be both of those things at the same time? I think it is, but it's strange.",
        "Sean: Do you think we need new stories?  ",
        "Sean: In that piece, you described Fargo, and it was so interesting to read that piece as, as  someone who've, I've watched all of the seasons of Fargo and I have lots of thoughts about it. It’s one of my favorite shows ever. But you describe it as a tragedy based on an inability to communicate, and said that that is actually also a good way to describe the current American predicament.And now I'm quoting you, right? You say we have two sides that both feel aggrieved, each believes that their own pain is real and that the others’ is a fantasy. I mean, is that another way of saying that both sides are trapped in misleading stories about each other?",
        "Sean: That's funny. I always think of tragedy as just like a collision of terrible options, where  resolution is simply not in the cards.",
        "Sean: In that Atlantic piece, you, you know, you're writing about a very particular species of  violence animated by a very American way of thinking. What do you mean when you say that it's high noon in America?",
        "Sean: Right. ",
        "Sean: Why do you think we love that so much here? Why do you think we love that reluctant  hero myth, right? This idea that ,like, there's this good man just trying to live his life in solitude and peace and he is forced by dint of circumstances to like rise up and you know, take down this villain or this evil or whatever.What is it about that that appeals so deeply to us?",
        "Sean: Yeah. ",
        "Sean: Yeah. ",
        "Sean: I'm, I mean, I'm vaguely aware of these sort of cultural myths and how they appear in  various stories, but the way you connect them with the current pop culture is very interesting to me. You know, I hadn't heard anyone, or read anyone until I read your piece, draw this comparison between The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones.Two shows that I have watched. And you point out how these two shows are… not just different. They offer different and really competing visions of human nature and political virtue. Can you say a bit about that distinction ‘cause it is quite useful.",
        "Sean: I just have never thought of The Walking Dead as a conservative show. Not conservative  in the sense of like Republican, I mean conservative on like a very deep level. Like as anchored in this view of the world that basically says, yeah, when the veneer of civilization slips away, your neighbor will absolutely kill you for a can of tuna… or for a gallon of gas.And part of me is attracted to that view, if I'm being honest. And part of me is repelled by it, too… but I don't think it's entirely wrong. You know.. I remember post-Katrina New Orleans — I was living in Louisiana when that happened.And you know, part of me agrees with the Joker in The Dark Knight, that when the chips are down, people will eat each other. And part of me thinks… well, that might be true, but that's not the whole story of humanity. And obsessing over the worst parts of us is a very good way to bring about those worst parts of us. Does that make sense?",
        "Sean: Do you think, if you had those two shows, Walking Dead in Game of Thrones? If you had  these two competing shows in parallel 10 years ago, do you think the popularity would've kind of mapped that neatly onto our partisan divisions, or do you think that really is a function of just where we're at right now in this moment?",
        "Sean: And that's why I love it, I think. Because it blurs the lines in those ways. And, we love the  idea of the good guy and the bad guy, and we love the idea tangentially of the vigilante, right?It's why we love Batman, and we love the idea that some things are so bad that you, it requires the reluctant hero to step outside the law, to step outside the norms and do what has to be done in the name of preserving freedom or liberty or whatever.",
        "Sean: Lots of people have always believed lots of ridiculous things like Pizzagate, but the  internet is such a game changer in terms of our ability to curate our reality, and maybe in some bizarre way it has amplified the power of these stories.About frontier justice or civilizational threats and made them more ridiculous in the process. I But that fact almost makes it more worrisome because it speaks to this inexorable journey from fantasizing about violence to doing violence and how that line is very weirdly blurred at the moment ",
        "Sean: This question of men and, I'm glad you went there. You take it on in the piece. There's  just no question that something that is happening right now is that young men in particular are being radicalized, as you put it, by the closed information loop of internet America.This is something I think a lot about, and you wrote something that really captured my attention and, uh, I'll just quote you. You say, this is how it is with a certain type of American male. They start with Nietzsche, they end with carnage. I'll just ask you what you, what you meant by that and, and we can riff on it a little bit.",
        "Sean: Yep. ",
        "Sean: Good lord. ",
        "Sean: It's a really bad idea to read Nietzsche if you’re drunk on this, on a cocktail of delusion  and resentment because you know, It's not an accident that he's so appealing to young men in particular. Right? I mean, he's subversive and brilliant and kind of punk rock.just bullshit constructs. And that most of what we call morality is really just an attempt to stifle the strong, creative individual. ",
        "Sean: And of course he's very interesting, right? But the problem is that young men read him  and think they're the powerful individual being restrained by society.And when you're young and impressionable, you long for that sense of mission and higher purpose. You wanna float above the herd, to use his language, and Nietzsche speaks directly to those fantasies. And if the line between fantasy and reality is already blurred in your mind, that's a very dangerous place to be.",
        "Sean: One thing that's just so clear to me, you know, look, young men are always gonna be a  challenge for society. They just will be.And it's, it is a weird, awkward thing, figuring out what the hell it means to be a man or how to define your manhood. And young men in particular will always do incredibly stupid and dangerous things. But if our culture doesn’t provide rites of passages or if it's dysfunctional, if we don't have healthy ways to express masculinity, if we don't have healthy models of masculinity, if we lack social infrastructure for young boys, uh, if we just don't have anything productive to do, we're gonna have the big problem.And obviously, the funhouse mirror that is the internet, and the orgy of grievances that that unleashes, boy, that's um, that makes things even worse.",
        "Sean: I was intrigued when you wrote in your piece that on the next season of Fargo, you're  going to champion a different vision of justice. Right? A more collective vision of justice, you write.One that doesn't just romanticize or lionize the reluctant hero. What’s your thinking behind that?",
        "Sean: Does trying to tell a story like that right now feel like an attempt to conquer your own  cynicism, or is it coming from a place of genuine hopefulness.",
        "Sean: Yeah. But even that piece, you know, it, it ends on a very somber, sobering note. You  know, you're describing your, your efforts to answer your son's question about, what the hell are we gonna do about all these mass shootings? it by saying, well, we're gonna buy more guns.",
        "Sean: I mean, not only that, there's just no shared reality left. I mean, even the disclaimer, you  know, in the beginning of Fargo, right — “This is a true story” is its own kind of deconstruction of ",
        "Sean: Do you think there are any unifying stories left in our culture? One of the most depressing  realizations for me, in the last several years, was that, it really does seem to me that nothing, quite literally nothing, including a once in a century pandemic, there is nothing that can't immediately get subsumed by this ongoing culture war.And if that's the case, then I don't really know where to go…",
        "Sean: …from there. And I don't really know what kind of stories we could tell that would  resonate with the entire country because the country is inhabiting very different spheres.",
        "Sean: Yeah. I mean, it says a lot about how, it's not the stories so much that matter. It’s when  and where we're reading them because we're always projecting.",
        "Sean:  If we're taking our Jesus a la carte, then what… why can't we take everything else that  way?",
        "INTRO: Think about where you live. Why do you live there? And since 2020....do you find  yourself wanting... a different home, somewhere else?Since that landmark year, the American home buying and rental markets have gone from hitting record lows…. to exceeding record highs. And pandemic-era economic changes are the driver. Many of us are now working from home, and have re-thought where we can and want to live…. Which means people are moving. In fact, there are fewer homes available for sale than ever -- there just isn't enough supply for all the demand. And that has all kinds of ripple effects – especially on those who are unhoused or on the verge of losing their homes. In this country, there isn't a safety net if you're on the edge. So, the number of people experiencing homelessness is on the rise. Why can't we keep up with the supply of houses....and what do we owe our fellow human beings when it comes to shelter?ID: I’m Sean Illing, and this is The Gray Area.music My guest today is Jerusalem Demsas. She’s a staff writer at The Atlantic and she used to be a policy reporter here at Vox…you might even recognize her as the former co-host of The Weeds.Demsas is a housing policy expert….she can explain the market – past and present – better than anybody I know. But, as you'll hear, she's also keenly aware that human beings are at the heart of housing...and that where we live, or can't live… has a dramatic effect on our lives.So I invited Jerusalem on the show to talk about all this… and the first thing I wanted to know was… how did she get drawn in the first place to write about… housing in the first place?",
        "Is there a simple way for you to sum up what's actually broken about housing policy  in this country other than the fact that the rent's too damn high?",
        "Sean: So, I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, but we're not afraid to ask the stupid questions  around here, so I'm gonna ask it anyway. Do we even have a clear definition of what - to use, the phrase, I think you used – what affordable, accessible housing actually means?",
        "Sean: I know you've argued that a, a big part of the problem is this, you know, mythos of home  ownership in this country and we'll, we'll get to that, uh, a little bit later. I just have to say that I, I kind of hate you for making this argument because I'm a homeowner and I know you're correct, but I'm already decked deep in this sinkhole of money and I can't back out now, so I'm just gonna lean into my cognitive dissonance, I guess.",
        "Sean: Just don't buy a house with foundation issues. I'm gonna drop that nugget. I'm gonna  moonwalk right outta the virtual room. I wanna ask you how much of the homelessness problem in this country – and that's something I really wanted to to to dive into in this conversation – how much of that problem is the direct result of our housing policies? In other words, how much of the homelessness problem has been effectively engineered in this country?",
        "Sean: You know, and I appreciate that you go there with this, you know, because it's like, you  know, you can ask like, so, you know, what's the, what's the link between housing, affordability and homelessness?  And, of course, some might roll their eyes and go, well, if houses are too expensive or if we don't have enough, then there will be lots of people experiencing homelessness.But it is more complicated than that. And part of the problem is that a lot of us probably have preconceived notions about what it means to lose your home and what that looks like. So we’re missing a lot of what’s going on here. ",
        "Sean: Okay, so if we have a supply problem, then that means we have a building stuff problem.  Which leads to the question, why is it so damn hard to build things, to build houses, more houses in this country? Why is it so much more expensive here than it is in other places?",
        "Sean: Is part of the story there cultural, like has home ownership became more and more of a  status symbol, I guess in some sense? That the drive to create bigger and bigger and bigger houses and have more space between houses, that this is all sort of like compounding and contributing to the problem.",
        "Sean: Correct me if I'm wrong on anything here, but you know, other countries allow the state to  regulate and enforce environmental standards or building codes or that sort of thing. But here, the whole process – I'm not sure if it's right to say that it runs through the legal system – but the process is vulnerable to the legal system in ways that just continually undercut efforts to build things.",
        "Sean: Right.  ",
        "Sean: Well, I mean this intersects with an argument you've made – I think correctly – about the  contradictions of liberal ideology. You know, liberals want housing to be affordable, especially for groups that have been excluded in the past. But that bumps up against the material interest of incumbent homeowners who use the system of laws and regulations we've created in the name of transparency and fairness –but they use them to protect their own wealth. And I think that's just a fact of the matter – and I think it's important to just call it out. And you do.",
        "Sean: yep. ",
        "Sean: Yeah. Fancy that, huh? So you just mentioned an example from California and, you know, California is what everyone likes to point to as the case study of what's wrong or broken in this space. Do you think that's why, I mean, does California for lots of reasons, exemplify or distill all of these problems?",
        "Sean: So is the, you know, the Nimbyism problem you were just talking about with Mark  Andreessen, you know, that's 'not in my backyard' for those unfamiliar with the term – is that phenomenon unusually bad in California? Or are we just more aware of it in California?",
        "Sean: Yeah. And look, I don't wanna paint every person who opposes developments, you know,  in their neighborhood as cartoon villains. I mean, I get that people move to certain places, to certain neighborhoods because they like the aesthetics of that place. Or they like the community in that place. And these things are fragile and they can change or go away and make the place different or unrecognizable. And that is a not trivial concern. I do just wanna say that. How much of this do you think is just a scarcity problem, right? This is a country without social safety nets, where everyone is kind of on their own, where the only way to secure your future and your family's future is to just acquire as much wealth and resources as possible.And it's not hard to see how that imperative collides with the housing crisis. You know, people, they're defending their property values. And in a country where homes are such a huge financial asset, I get it.",
        "Sean: An argument I often hear, mostly from conservatives, is that progressive cities like San  Francisco or LA or New York City have bigger homeless populations because they provide all these welfare services, which in the end just enable the very problems they purport to solve. Now we have some data on this, right? And it disproves this claim, no?",
        "Sean: I wanna circle back a little bit to what I was joking about earlier – about this, you know,  the mythos of home ownership. And, you know, the story that we've all been told in this country don't waste money on rent, buy a house, build equity, cash out later after the value of your house has increased. And then you just buy a nicer home. And so it goes, it's the American dream. Do you think that's A, wrong and B, something we really have to rethink or let go of in order to mitigate – I won't say solve, but mitigate – the problems we're talking about.",
        "Sean: Well that's also part of what makes it a bit of a shaky investment for lower and middle  class people in particular because a lot of the wealth gains to be had are rooted in luck and in the places where you can be more sure of the value increasing – well, those are the places that are obscenely expensive to buy – and you can't, the barriers to entry are too high anyway, so you're kind of screwed.",
        "Sean: This is related to the homelessness problem we're talking about, because we have this  current dynamic of pushing people into buying houses, and at the same time we have this policy preference for never-ending rising housing prices. And that just punishes newcomers. It just makes it harder and harder and harder and harder for people to get into the home ownership game. When the music stops, there are a lot of people without a chair.",
        "Sean: I mean, Part of the problem now – the homeless problem in particular – as that  intensifies, people become more responsive to reactionary and draconian policies. They just wanna criminalize homelessness. They just wanna just get it the hell off my radar, get it off the streets, at all costs.But in the end, that just ensures that the underlying problems will persist. Right. That's a road to nowhere, or nowhere good.",
        "Sean: Yeah. And I just feel like as a society, we just don't really have an answer to a really  basic question, which is, what do we owe our fellow human beings? Or, we have many answers, but certainly no consensus. And part of what's interesting to me about this problem is that it doesn't really collapse neatly along conventional, partisan, or ideological lines. There's never a perfect equivalent on anything. But the left and the right really don't have an answer for this. And they contribute in different ways to the problem. And in the interest of being real, like – I think a lot of people, most people perhaps, don't want to bear the cost of doing what's right here.And the uncomfortable reality is that if you really drill down, a majority of people in this country have internalized our very hyper-individualistic culture, and many of us are comfortable and there's not a lot of appetite for real sacrifice. And maybe some of that has to do with the scarcity problem we were talking about earlier.And maybe some of it is just the fact that this is a very libertarian society. And the bigger the country gets, the more atomized the country gets, the more these sorts of collective action problems become insoluble.",
        "Sean: Yeah. I'm constantly searching for ways to explain a dynamic that exists in other spaces.  Like healthcare in particular. So even if you're someone who, on a moral or ideological level, doesn't believe healthcare or housing is a human right, there's still the fact that as a society we are paying a price for these problems, one way or the other.Don't give people healthcare? Well, they end up in the emergency room and that drives up cost. Don't provide housing livable wages, a basic social infrastructure to people? Crime and other social pathologies go up. You have more people that end up in prison. And we all pay for that, right? Like, there's no way we're not paying for this one way or the other. ",
        "Sean: And so, like, pretending like the problem doesn't exist and just retreating into our  libertarian cocoon, that's not gonna get the job done, that's not gonna make anything better. It's certainly not gonna make these problems go away.",
        "Sean: You said it better than me. Even if you have some aversion to charity or, you can't help  but think of people who have fallen, you know, into bad times as responsible in some way for their own plight.This is still, even if that's your point of view, this is still in your interest to address. I think that's just a key point. So, I will leave it there. And I'll just say like, this was an education for me as someone who doesn't think about these sorts of questions very often. So thank you for helping me do it, Jerusalem.",
        "INTRO: Here’s a phrase you don’t hear much anymore: “Post-racial” If you were around back in 2008, this was a popular term…America had its first Black President, the vibes were good, lots of optimism … where all things are possible… tonight is your answer.But Obama’s victory very quickly gave way to a reactionary movement on the Right…And….  since then….NEWSCASTER: Police cars set on fire. Officers attacked. The fury ignited after 46-year-old George Floyd died.MATT GAETZ: There is an attempted cultural genocide going on in America right now.BEN SHAPIRO: Critical race theory essentially argues that racism is baked into all the systems of American society.…the idea of a post-racial America seems naive.Is there anything we could do, individually or as a society, that could get us back to that optimism for a post-racial America?ID: I’m Sean Illing, and this is The Gray Area.music My guest today is Thomas Chatteron Williams … He’s a contributing writer at The Atlantic and the author of Losing My Cool and Self-Portrait in Black and White … Both of which are memoirs about his collision with race and identity in America.Williams is a controversial figure … His ideas about race are certainly unorthodox and that has earned him a ton of critics … On the left and the right…It’s not entirely accurate to say that Williams is calling for a “post-racial” America … But he’s definitely asking us as individuals to transcend race as an identity… For him, our racial categories are prisons … And as long as we’re trapped inside them, we’ll never escape the oppression they’ve helped create.It’s a provocative argument for sure … and for that reason it’s also the kind of argument we love to engage around here … So I invited Williams onto the show to talk about it…music Thomas Chatterton Williams, welcome to the show. Thomas Chatterton Williams: Thanks for having me.Sean: So I wanna start with your background just a little bit. The way you talk about these  issues is really through the lens of your own life and your own experiences.",
        "Sean: So when you were growing up, did you feel your racial identity was a kind of  performance? Did you feel pressure to perform your race in that way?",
        "Sean: So when did that binary logic of race that you grew up in, we all kind of grow up in, when  did that start to crumble for you? When did your self-conception really begin to shift?",
        "Sean: So fast forwarding to the present. You just used the word category. You know, is the  main problem for you the fact that we seem to be trapped in these racial categories?",
        "Sean: Yeah. You know, I will say that I share your discomfort with racial essentialism for lots of  reasons. I mean, I guess the most obvious of which is that the most committed racial essentialist are also the most committed racist.",
        "Sean: You know who loves racial essentialism? Richard Spencer. You know, the whole notion  of his or anyone's white supremacy sort of falls apart without the bogus claim that white people are biologically distinct from, and therefore, superior to other races.",
        "Sean: I think as a service to the audience, it may help to just kind of say briefly what we mean  by race essentialism. I mean, for me it just, pretty simply, it just means the idea that every race has some kind of essence that makes it distinct and separate and often better or less than other racial groups.I don't know if that maps with your definition.",
        "Sean: Yeah. Yeah. ",
        "Sean: All right, let's get into the meat of this.  My instinct, like the place I'm coming from, is a kind of lefty class politics. And for me, the political toxicity of race makes me want to avoid it as much as possible because I think it often makes achieving social justice more difficult because of the toxicity.But I also understand that it's incredibly easy for me to say that. I'm not just trying to say the right thing here. You know, I'm genuinely conflicted about what I don't understand, maybe what I can't understand about my own blind spots. I just wanna put that out there on the table.",
        "Sean: Yeah, well, you get lots of points for invoking Camus I, we've done a couple episodes  about him. ",
        "Sean: Yeah, he's, uh, one of my moral heroes, as nerdy as that sounds. ",
        "Sean: Oh, right on. Anyway, we're off the tracks.  music Alright, we'll get ourselves back on track here… ",
        "Sean: So how then would you describe your political project, do you want us to transcend race  altogether? Is that ultimately the goal?",
        "Sean: Well, I mean, the thing about identity, I mean, every identity, you're right, is a social  construct. But that means it's not just a decision we make as individuals, right? It's something that's affirmed and reinforced and often imposed on us by other people.",
        "Sean: Yes, that's a better word for it. ",
        "Sean: For you, like when does adherence to a social category like race become so ingrained  that it effectively takes on the significance of a biological category?",
        "Sean: I find myself struggling in these ways when I'm having conversations about  postmodernism or something like that, where it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Most of our categories, maybe all of our categories, depending on who you ask, are just totally foundationless If you plumb them to their depths, really.And I just don't know how much that fact really matters in a practical sense since we are such socially embedded creatures. And you know, at some point, and I don't know when this becomes just kind of an academic exercise, and then once we step out of the seminar room, we're bombarded by the realities of the social world that we live in.",
        "Sean: We may agree on this. I mean, I, part of the problem for me is that too much of this  discussion is actually anchored to – or it's happening in elite spaces. And part of what I try to do on the show and in my life, just as a moral exercise, is try really hard to imagine the world from the perspective of someone who's living a very different kind of life. To the extent that that's possible. If you're a Black person occupying a very different social space than someone like you or me now today – do you really have a choice to not identify as Black if the world you swim in every day is constantly reinforcing that identity?",
        "Sean: Yeah, I mean, I, I think race and class and all these things intersect in really complicated  ways. You know, I don't know if — it may well be that a poor white kid and a poor Black kid in Mississippi have more in common or have a more similar experience of the world than a poor black kid in Mississippi and a very rich Black kid in Manhattan or San Francisco or something like that.",
        "Sean: I mean, I don't know. I'm, I'm speculating. ",
        "Sean: Yeah, I mean, I guess the point I was just getting at is that someone living a very different  life under very different conditions is gonna experience the world differently and therefore have a different set of choices and pressures. Which isn't to say that even then there isn't some degree of freedom to choose or think differently, but it is to say that it's hard, man, like really hard.",
        "Sean: Yeah. And even saying that class and race intersect in complicated ways isn’t an  argument for ignoring race. I mean, that – that doesn't work either. It's just to say that the picture is really muddled because, well, reality is really freaking muddled, you know? ",
        "Sean: And this is partly why class transitions from one generation to another can be so  disorienting to families.Maybe race isn't real in the particular way that you're talking about, but a common experience in the world produces a shared consciousness, and that's real.",
        "Sean: You're not necessarily asking Black people to give up their racial identity altogether.  You're really asking white people to give up their whiteness.",
        "Sean: Is that something that has to happen first or is this something that has to happen  simultaneously or, or what? Because I think this is actually an important point.",
        "Sean: Yeah, I guess what I'm pushing on here is… so these categories were imposed on Black  Americans by white Americans, right? So it's not like Black self-awareness is the cause of anti-black racism. ",
        "Sean: Right. And even the lefty materialist in me has to say that even, even if on a cultural and  psychological level, hell, the metaphysical level, even if Black people and white people were to abandon these constructs yesterday, we'd still be confronting the material disparities in our world, say, in our criminal justice system or, wherever. Right?",
        "Sean: Making a move on one front doesn't eliminate or do anything about the problem on the  other, and that – I don't know what to do then, you know?",
        "Sean: Yeah. Yeah. ",
        "Sean: Yeah. I mean, I would reject that false choice for sure. Right. I don't think when you're  dealing with social problems, I don't think it ever makes sense to focus on only one variable. Right?",
        "Sean: I can imagine plenty of Black Americans – well, I don't have to imagine this, plenty of  Black Americans have these arguments – that the racial cleavage in this country is so deep and so central to our history and our culture, that Blackness isn't something they can escape, even if they want to. And therefore their Blackness has to be defended and asserted.Does that make any sense to you?",
        "Sean: That may well be, I mean, I, I guess I'm thinking like, in a purely political frame, the thrust  of the point I was just making is that, you know, Black solidarity might be politically essential for achieving racial justice. Right. And sacrificing that, or throwing that off would very likely just favor the status quo. Right? And if you're on the wrong end of the status quo, that's a problem. Sometimes the insistence on a very individualist view of the world runs into a wall for me. You know, the individual becomes too abstracted from the concrete realities of social life. And I just dunno how far that can take us, you know?",
        "Sean: This is an area for me where in a lot of ways the political questions are harder than the  ethical questions, right? Like even if we can agree on normative questions, the question of like, okay, well what's the best way to achieve these things given all the political constraints? I don't know the answer to that is, I don't know that anyone has an answer to that. But one thing I have said before on this show is that there is always a potential trap that we can get so invested in our identities and our struggles for meaning and justice that it can become very difficult to move beyond them no matter how much material conditions improve. And I know I'm really leaning into my ambivalence in this conversation, but I do share concern, if that's the right word, that our current politics, in a lot of ways, is a perpetual ripping off of old wounds. And that can breed a lot of inertia and stuckness and frustration. But then at the same time, leaning too much into that feels like a turning away from fresh, open wounds.And sometimes it's hard to know where the old wounds end and the fresh wounds begin. Or even if there's a line between them at all.",
        "Sean: Look, I can say for sure that I would much rather live in a world where our race was the  least interesting, least notable thing about us. I just don't know that we'll ever get there and, and maybe I end up somewhere between the pessimism of someone like a Ta-Nahesi Coates, and some of what I would call some optimism in your work.But, you know, we, we are such tribal creatures. We derive so much meaning from the distinctions we make between ourselves and other people. And it is so stupid and so dangerous. But race seems to be an irresistible distinction for our species. And in any case, it is a distinction that is imposed on us. And more importantly, it's a distinction that has produced real concrete inequalities. And I'm not sure we can deal with those and let go of those distinctions at the same time. Or I'm not sure if we can let go of those distinctions UNTIL we've addressed those inequalities.And maybe that's where, maybe that's where I land on this.",
        "Sean: Like you mentioned France. You live in France and, and they don't keep track of race in  the same ways that we do, but France is still a deeply racist society in lots of ways, even though they don't formally recognize race the way we do. Which I guess just sort of raises that question, right, like, does ignoring race do anything to undercut what we'd all agree are racist outcomes?And clearly it doesn't, or it's not sufficient.",
        "INTRO - COLD: The killing of Tyre Nichols by five police officers in Memphis, Tennessee is the  latest, horrific example of police brutality in America. \tI haven’t watched the video of the officers pepper spraying, tasing, chasing, kicking, clubbing, and punching Nichols during a traffic stop, which led to his death — but… I’ve read the comparisons to the 1991 Rodney King beating… and, I’ve listened to the cries of his grieving family members. Reports say that during the fatal beating, Nichols called out.. for his mom.The fact that the officers were all Black, as is the police chief, and that they were all quickly fired.. and now face charges.. including second-degree murder — doesn’t mean policing has improved. Police still kill more than 1,000 Americans every year and it was nearly 1,200 in 2022 — the deadliest on record. And unarmed Black people are killed by police at three times the rate of unarmed white people.The conversation about the need to change policing reached a high point in 2020 following the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, which incited some of the biggest protests the country has ever seen. But, since then, Congress has failed to do anything, like pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which would have ended qualified immunity for police officers. And it’s worth pointing out… much of the reform options that have been proposed and debated in the past couple years wouldn’t have saved Tyre Nichols.It’s why years after ideas like defund and abolish the police reached the mainstream, we’re still wondering… What would America look like if we poured its large police budgets into other public safety measures, into health care, into education, and into housing? What would society look like without the police?ID: I’m Fabiola Cineas, and this… is The Gray Area.INTRO - HOT: My guest today is Derecka Purnell. She’s a lawyer and activist whose 2021 book Becoming Abolitionists chronicles her journey from police abolition skeptic to someone now dreaming up a world without the police. Derecka’s work holds a mirror up to the institution of policing and questions not only its origins… but who it serves — and harms — today. I spoke to Derecka a little over a year ago about what it was like to grow up and call the police for everything… but then to realize that the people you’re calling for help can hurt you. And, of course, we discuss some common questions she gets like — what about rape and murder… and wouldn’t Black women be some of the most vulnerable people in a society without the police? But I wanted to start by taking a step back. What does it really.. even.. mean.. to call yourself a police abolitionist?music ",
        "Mmm. That is not a simple answer.  I just want to get a sense of how you're feeling in this moment. I feel like you've been in the hot seat for a while now. I've watched since like early 2020 people just outright dismiss your abolitionists visions. How does it feel to champion an idea that people seem to hate so much, but then at the same time, it's an idea that's being so well received. People are talking about abolition in a way that, I don't think we've talked about before. ",
        "Fabiola: So in the beginning of your book, you talk about how the idea of abolition actually  used to repulse you. So that's a pretty strong thing to say for someone who is championing abolition so strongly right now. So can you walk me through that journey? When did you first learn of abolition as a concept and what really drew you in?",
        "Fabiola: And how does being a member of the Trayvon generation factor into your quest to  learn more about abolition? ",
        "Fabiola: And as you said before, abolition is definitely not a new concept. Like for me right  now, I'm reading this book called The Black Jacobins. It's like the definitive account of the Haitian revolution published in 1938. And I'm like blown away by chapters that talk about the Maroons, right? Just groups of people who've fled and lived in the mountains for decades and decades and would come down here and there to try to get this revolution started. And it's like, I never learned about these things in school. So it's just like abolition does have a very long history, but it sounds like you're also kind of forging a new kind of abolition where you're saying, I don't think that capitalism and abolition can coexist. So can you talk a little bit about your specific brand of abolition and how it might differ from people who were talking about abolition some decades ago? ",
        "Fabiola: So I want to talk some more about how we develop the attachment that we have to  the police in the United States. I grew up in New York city. When I was in high school, senior year, I was violently mugged in my neighborhood in Brooklyn. And it's kind of a crazy story because it happened so fast. Like I was coming out of the train station with, two of my friends. It was around like five o'clock. So the sun was already down because it was like fall season. I had a bag on my shoulder. It was like college application season. So I had my laptop in there. I had important like paperwork for the colleges that I was filling out.When I was, like, coming out of the train, these two guys just come up behind me and they just tug really hard on my shoulder, pull my bag. I try to, you know, stop them from getting it. They get it, they start running. What was crazy is I decided in my mind, it wasn't like, Oh, my God, let me grab my phone and call the police. I decided to chase them down. I was like, what I need right now is my bag. Yeah. So I started chasing these two guys up Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn and the one who had my bag went down like a dark little street and the other one who didn't have my bag, like one up toward Eastern Parkway. I'm chasing the one with my bag, but then when we like, kind of get to the middle of the block, he slows down and I kinda got scared. I'm like, Oh no, maybe he might pull out like a knife or a gun or something. Let me stop. So // then I went back and joined my friends. They had no idea what happened. And it was only then when I was like, I guess I should call the cops. So I called the police, tell them what happened. They were like, alright, we'll send someone out. And we weren't too far from a precinct in Brooklyn. They show up maybe like 20 minutes later I described what happened. They took me down to the station. They actually sat me down with a sketch artist. I described, uh, what the two guys look like. I assume they put pictures up around the neighborhood or just kept it in their file. And then in the weeks after I did ride-alongs with the cops, so they would be like, yeah, meet us at this time. We'll take you around. So they parked me outside of, like, some basketball courts in the neighborhood. We sat outside of like popular restaurant. ",
        "Fabiola: Yeah. And it was, it was fascinating because I'm like, here I am, my bag with my  laptop was at this point stolen like three weeks ago. And I'm like sitting out in a car, like doing a lookout with the ",
        "Fabiola: yeah, it got to a point where I was like, all right, this is okay. Thank you so much for  your efforts.",
        "Fabiola: basically. Yeah. Basically seeing, trying to see if I could see these guys and I did feel  uncomfortable. A part of me was like, oh, this is nice of the cops to like, invest their time and doing this. But then I was also like, I'm not going to get my bag back. Also, if I see these guys on the court, I'm not going to sit and point them out. Like, it felt weird. And so whenever I think of, like, abolition or calls to the front of the police, I always think back to that interaction that I had with police officers. Cause it was kind of like the crime wasn't prevented. you know, my bag was long gone. I still wasn't safe. You know, my mom, whenever I would leave the house was still like. Be careful, don't take your phone out on the train. And this was during the height of stop and frisk. So we, there were cops everywhere. And so even with knowing that in that small moment, the police didn't help me out. There was still this idea in my mind of like, okay, I guess things are better because there are cops standing, you know, on my block in Brooklyn patrolling.So can you just talk about why you think so many people hold on to the police as just something, as you also describe in your book? ",
        "Fabiola: That's a fair point. ",
        "Fabiola: So I do want to get into this idea that the police can be reformed. There are so many  people, especially liberals, especially liberal politicians who many of us really look up to who say, you know what, we hear what you're saying to defund movement. We hear what you're saying, abolitionists. Maybe not saying that, but ,they're saying, you know what, in the past, for example, if we take community policing right Biden, when he was campaigning in 2020, it was saying we just have not put enough money toward community policing. It was never fully funded. So we need to continue with that program.Why do you say that police reform isn't the answer and I'll list off some other reforms, whether it's like community oversight boards, we have the banning of chokeholds. We have diversifying police forces, you know, just have more chiefs who are black, for example. Why aren't these reforms enough, according to what you've argued many times.",
        "Fabiola: Yeah, that makes me think of, um, the example of Camden county and how a lot of  people love to look at Camden as this model for police reform. So in 2013, Camden disbanded its police force, and then it kind of rebuilt it and replaced it with a county-wide one. And crime did decrease, right? So looking at numbers from a Reuters story, the police reported 1,161 violent crime incidents in 2019. And that was down 42% since 2012. And then excessive force complaints also dropped. So three were reported, um, and registered in 2019 down from 65 in 2014. But then there are also reports of this program just being copaganda. Like yes, the, the crime rate has gone down, but it's also a matter of aggressive policing, policing that's focused on broken windows policy and also just surveillance.So there is a piece from Brendan McQuade in The Appeal. And it talks about how police, from July to October, 2014, the Camden county police wrote up 99 tickets for riding a bicycle without a bell. And they basically struggled to process about 125,000 different cases, citation, tickets that were issued by the new force between 2013 and 2014. And so it was like a 97,000 case increase from the previous year. And most of those cases were for petty offenses. So what is your response to the fact that data is skewed? It looks like even, there are studies that show policing works to decrease crime. So if we look at different strategies like deterrence or hotspot policing, like one study, for example, found that deploying police in high crime areas was associated with less crime in New York City. So I just threw a lot at you, but just any kind of comment on the fact that there is some research that suggests that policing can be successful to reduce crime. But then it's also like, should we be thinking of crime reduction as our only goal to society, to bettering society? ",
        "Fabiola: So does that mean that a combination of policing and increased social services can  lead to the kind of society that you envision?",
        "Fabiola: And there's also the argument that accountability is what we need, right?  Accountability will improve policing. So Derek Chauvin, what happened in that trial was unprecedented. The fact that there were people in his own department willing to speak up against him and say what he did to George Floyd was completely unlawful.So is there an avenue where holding police officers accountable and really holding them to task, uh, with their behavior. Is there any way that that could help us achieve the society that you envision. ",
        "Fabiola: And I've watched people get curious about abolition, and a lot of black women too.  Right. but they'll stop engaging when they get to the, what do we do about the rapists? Won't we still have murderers. What do we do with them? How do we address the rise in crime? Like in 2020, the U S 's murder rate went up by almost 30%. So people seem eager to get to these gotcha moments to try to counter the abolitionist imagination. But then it's also a legitimate fear within us of just like, we're not safe. We're not going to be safe. How do you approach that? ",
        "Fabiola: Yeah. So more information is just that the murder rate went up in 2020, but crime  overall fell by four or 5% in 2020. ",
        "Fabiola: Absolutely.  ",
        "Fabiola: So something that I see people tend to do, um, in conversations about abolitionists.  First, they say, oh, that's a utopia because getting rid of the root causes of crime still won't address people who are naturally inclined to hurt other people. What is your response to that? Like, do you believe that humans are just inclined to be violent and want to kind of get over on other people or, or is that capitalism? Is that our socialization that has caused us to be this way? Right? Like the person who took the bike from your car? ",
        "Fabiola: So in thinking about getting there, is there a specific plan or roadmap for abolition?  Like what is the relationship between abolition and time, like is abolition right now? Or is there like a future date that you're working toward or are the actions that we're doing today all considered part of the abolitionist dream. ",
        "Fabiola: Are there ever any moments when you feel like abolition just feels way too big, too  daring for us to just imagine our liberation in that way and just demand it? ",
        "Fabiola: Yeah, throughout this whole conversation, I've just been thinking about Dylann Roof.  For me, when I think of, like, the most violence, I think about Dylann Roof. And I'm just like, wow, what kind of world should we be imagining right now, can we create, so that something or someone like a Dylann Roof, right, shooting up churchgoers. So that couldn't happen again, or just never happened? Like what kind of world could we live in? Do you have time for one more question, Derecka? And it's just a question about the future. ",
        " Fabiola: Awesome. So it's 200 years from now and we've achieved abolition. For me in you,  black women. what are we able to do in the conclusion of your book? You talk about neighborhood councils, childcare. You talk about conflict resolution, health clinics, green teams. So what do we have access to 200 years from now? And what are we able to do? ",
        "Fabiola: wow. I'm very, very jealous of them as well. So jealous. I really just had a vision in  mind of just all of that. ",
        "Fabiola: Yeah. I saw the  ",
        "INTRO: Sean Iling: It’s hard to understand the culture of policing in America.. from the outside…There’s an informal code among police officers … They call it “the blue wall of silence”... And it’s pretty much what it sounds like: an ethos that encourages cops to not talk about what happens at work … To protect their own, really…Lots of people have studied the police — who they are, what they believe in and how they see the people they’re meant to protect and serve— but it remains a system filled with problems and one that’s opaque if you’re not a copThat’s an issue for all kinds of reasons … the outrage against cops and the tension between them and civilians has been mounting … It hit a breaking point in 2020, as everyone knows...and it’s top of mind, once again, following the killing of Tyre Nichols last month in Memphis …The relationship between the police and citizens is about as strained as it’s ever been – at least in my lifetime…So what can we do about this? How can we fix policing in this country?ID: I’m Sean Illing, and this is The Gray Area.music My guest today is Rosa Brooks … She’s a law professor at Georgetown University who’s spent most of her career in the national security world … But she became a reserve cop with the Washington DC Metro Police Department back in 2015…After graduating from the police academy, Brooks worked part time as a patrol officer from 2016 to 2020 and eventually wrote a book about her experiences called Tangled Up in Blue: Policing the American City…As we continue to grapple with issues of police brutality and questions about how to reform policing in the United States, I wanted to reconnect with Brooks - I interviewed for vox dot com back in May 2021, in the aftermath of the Derek Chauvin trial. She knows what it’s like to do the work, she also has enough perspective to understand what’s broken. We started out by talking about what motivated her to become a cop in the first place. music ",
        "Sean: Yeah ",
        "Sean: Yeah. We're definitely gonna talk about the training and the mindset and how that is  woven into the culture. But you do make an important point, and that is just the brute fact that being a cop is a really hard job. We gotta figure out how to do it better. But it is a really hard job and we're in this moment.There's a lot of anti-police sentiment… ",
        "Sean: And a lot of distrust towards the police, a lot of which has been. Do cops feel justly,  villainized at this moment? Because I have to imagine if they do, that very much changes the way they see and do their jobs.",
        "Sean: You said something to me last time we spoke and I just wanted to, I wanna read it to  you if that's okay, and just have you clarify it. And you actually alluded to this a second ago. You said quote, “I see two profound truths that are in tension with one another. One is that policing in America perpetuates extremely unjust socioeconomic divisions, particularly along lines of race and policing in America is stunningly violent compared to policing elsewhere. But there's another profound truth, which is that the overwhelming majority of cops will never even point their weapon at another person during their entire career, much less shoot someone.”I'd love to hear more about why these truths are in tension and how that complicates our broader understanding about policing.",
        "Sean: I love what you said a minute ago. I just wanna flag it and then we'll, we'll keep on on  rolling here. People are overpoliced because they're under everything-elsed.",
        "Sean: that captures a lot. ",
        "Sean: I do wanna talk about how the profession is structured, though. Of course, there's a  discussion to be had here about the culture of policing and how it's broken and I think a helpful place to start is with the militarization of policing and a lot of the discourse, as you know, focuses on the gear and the hardware and the tactics, and that's all worth knowing.But I know you think the more profound problem here is how police departments are organized. Can you say a bit about that?",
        "Sean: Can you just give a little color there in terms of like, just so people have a visual, like  when you say they're training like it's 1980s Marine boot camp, is it the weapons they're using? What are they actually doing?",
        "Sean: But, are they playacting soldiers basically when they're going through these  academies?",
        "Sean: I bet. ",
        "Sean: I think that's right. One of the questions for me is, can cops train like warriors and  dress like warriors and behave like warriors without thinking like warriors, without thinking of themselves as soldiers on a battlefield fighting an enemy?",
        "Sean: Yeah, I mean, you, you talk about this in your book, you know, a lot of police culture  is built on this myth that the job is extremely dangerous and that. You know, there's no such thing as a routine call, right? Like you could be shot and killed at any moment, at any random traffic stop. And you, you talk about how that's kind of true and misleading at the same time.It is true in a sense. It is an extremely dangerous job and cops do get shot and and killed. But it's also misleading in the sense that that mindset, that cynicism and the kind of hardening that it produces, can lead you to perceive danger and aggression preemptively where it isn't there, and that can become self-fulfilling and create lethal situations that did not have to happen.",
        "Sean: That's worth just sitting with. Just for a second. Say that one more time because that  I think will surprise people.",
        "Sean: Jesus. ",
        "Sean: So is there a better way to prepare cops, to train cops so that they have a healthier,  safer approach to the job? I imagine part of this story here is how we screen cops before they're even hired. And I don't know if the answer is requiring college degrees, although my lefty roots will come out here because I, I'm not super comfortable with legislating blue collar workers out of any profession…",
        "Sean: …but I'm just thinking aloud and throwing it out there. ",
        "Sean: More emotionally mature. ",
        "Sean: I think a lot of people. May not know this or may be surprised to learn that America's  actually under policed relative to some European countries like France, say, countries like that have more cops per capita, but American cops are more violent. They kill more people. And obviously the question is, you know, why is that?And there are lots of reasons I'm sure, but there is a huge caveat here and you just mentioned it, which is that there are more guns than people in America. And that's not true in France or anywhere else that I'm aware of. Right? So the whole Second Amendment thing does complicate the picture and make the US an outlier case in, in lots of ways.",
        "Sean: Could you just say very briefly what qualified immunity means? I mean, obviously  you're a law professor, so you're equipped to.",
        "Sean: Thanks for clarifying that. And look, I don't know if there's any training that can  prevent someone from panicking when that fight or flight instinct kicks in, I mean that that's deep down in our wiring, but it's still shocking when you start looking at this how undertrained American police are. ",
        "Sean: It is incredible how little training these people have, and I suspect a lot of police  interactions that go wrong are not the result of bad people out to do bad things. It's the result of poorly trained human beings responding.",
        "Sean: Yeah, responding badly under duress in situations for which they're totally  unprepared, and that seems like a training slash screening problem.",
        "Sean: I live near New Orleans and I've been there quite a bit recently and it's, I don't know  how indicative this is of other cities around the country, but they've got a massive problem of simply not having enough cops. People are calling 911 and they're saying, sorry, nobody can respond. I mean, it's, it's a pretty dire situation.",
        "Sean: We've just witnessed the killing of Tyre Nichols down in Memphis.  ",
        "Sean: I'm not even sure where to start, to be honest. So I guess I'll ask… how you  processed what happened there.",
        "Sean: You know, a lot of people are learning about this elite unit, whatever the hell that  means. In the Memphis pd, they called it the Scorpion unit. This is the unit that was involved in the Nichols killing, and there are lots of comparable units like this across the country. You know, plain closed cops and unmarked cars using very aggressive tactics.What do you make of these types of units? Are they, are they dangerous by design? Is there any evidence that they work? Even if the tactics are a little dicey,",
        "Sean: reduce crime. ",
        "Sean: We've been sort of circling around some of the arguments about. Abolishing or, or  defunding the police. There are caricatured versions of these arguments and there are more nuanced versions of them, and I, I want to try to engage with the more nuanced versions of them. You know, and I'm not sure where you stand on any of this, but I'll, I'll start by just kind of laying my cards on the table.I mean, my main objection to a lot of these sorts of arguments is that I really do think we need to professionalize the police. ",
        "Sean: That is a phrase coined by others, not me. ",
        "Sean: Yeah, right, because if nothing else seemed like the right direction to go. But again,  very importantly, that would require more, not less funding.And for lots of reasons, people aren't really pumped about giving more money to cops who they continue to see on their screens brutalizing people.",
        "Sean: Yeah. ",
        "Sean: Right. ",
        "Sean: And this is the thing I would say in defense. I mean, the fact that cops spend so  much of their time on non-violent crimes and minor drug offenses and these sorts of things is such a problem. They should spend much more time screening, much more time doing training on de escalation and how to communicate more effectively.That's part of the professionalization I'm talking about. But also, they should be focused more on actual violent crimes because so much of the other stuff amounts to harassment and extortion and a waste of time and resources and I, I don't have any idea how many violent police interactions involve people with disabilities or mental health issues that never would've happened if those people had gotten the help they needed, which is why the call for better social services and more funding for social services are absolutely necessary.",
        "Sean: We ran an old Vox Conversations episode earlier this week with my terrific colleague,  Fabiola Cineas, and she was in dialogue with the police abolitionist whose name was Derecka Purnell. who made a lot of genuinely interesting points. But she also said something that crystallized a kind of first principle objection for me, and I'm curious what you think you know, she'd said that the goal was ultimately to eradicate violence from society.And for me, there will always be violence in society and we will need police to deal with it. And while I appreciate the call to imagine a different world and to reexamine our deepest assumptions about our current one. I am pretty firm on this point, as firm as I can be. And yet at the same time, I'm also a white guy who has never felt threatened by the police and I don't know what that's like.And I do think there's a moral obligation to take that seriously.",
        "Sean: Earlier you talked about some of the research on police training, and you talked  about the importance of instilling cops with a sense of self-confidence, so they aren’t acting out of fear. And I think we can say that, if that’s a goal of police training — and it seems a worthy goal… that it’s not working right now. Many cops report that they are afraid of getting into violent interactions, or about whether or not a suspect is armed. Especially in these high-profile instances of police violence, we hear that officers are afraid. So is there something that we can do in training to make cops less afraid? To instill them with more confidence, so that they aren’t primarily acting out of fear?",
        "Sean: We're dealing with an impossibly complicated dynamic and lots of people are justified  in their anger and there just isn't a way out of this. And it's partly because there is lots of anger to go around, justifiable anger to go around that we can't move forward. It's just, it's kind of dispiriting.",
        "Sean: Well, in the interest of ending this on a more constructive, optimistic note. You  mentioned the program that you, you help run at Georgetown for young cops in DC. This is a program where you talk about race and violence and the role of policing and all that stuff. Do you feel that work there is actually making a difference and giving you more hope?",
        "Rebecca: and I feel like the, the value of the hater or the position of the hater in wider  society has really evolved over time. Like I think we can trace the rise of like optimism in, you know, the 2010s as sort of this backlash to like hipsterdom and the poptimism of the 2000s as a backlash to like the nineties anti-sellout culture.Where do you think we are right now?",
        "Rebecca: Exactly.  ",
        "Rebecca: And hating, I feel like used to be a signal that you were cool, that you were better  than everybody because you hated a popular thing. Do you think that's kind of still the case or like what happened there?",
        "Rebecca: so something that I've noticed a lot, and I don't know if you see this in your  writing about music and entertainment, but I cover a lot of influencers and the main thing that I notice about talking to influencers or people that are, you know, not quite famous, but getting there or micro famous or niche famous, whatever.they tend to view the world in very like black and white. There's haters, and then there's fans or followers or supporters, whatever. You know, there's no room for like nuanced criticism at all because when you hear people shouting at you and shouting their opinions at you all the time, or that's at least what it feels like.The ones that stick out are, you know, the really positive ones. Like, oh my God, I love you, I'm obsessed with you. And the really negative ones like, oh my God, kill yourself. Which, uh, you know, most people don't feel that strongly about anything or anyone, but I think in turn it gives people this kind of brain where they are your enemies and then they're your supporters.And those are the only two kinds of people in the. And I've seen that kind of trickle down to regular people too, as we all kind of like are infected with influencer brain. And I'm wondering if that's something that you've noticed interviewing famous people or artists or things like that.",
        "Rebecca: The dream. ",
        "Rebecca: and I think like as journalists and critics and writers, like, it's kind of our job to do  that. But also, you know, it is a public facing role where you are online, you are accessible for people. When someone has a problem with what you write, you will know about it if they have a big enough problem.But I think as you know, more. People develop followings or even like mini followings. I'm shocked at how little fame or notoriety a person can have and start to adopt this way of thinking. ",
        "Rebecca: And again, like I truly think it's human nature. Of course it is. It's all about self- preservation and it's easier to deal with criticism when you just can like write off the whole group of people that have anything negative to say as like a hater.But at the same time, bringing up YouTubers is such a good point because the key phrase there is spreading positivity and spreading negativity. It is. My least favorite thing in the entire world, say Jake Paul or something. He's like, I'm just trying to spread positivity, man. Why is everyone coming after me?It's like, cuz you scammed all your 12 year old followers into like buying this fake crypto coin. And like probably stole their email addresses for something nefarious. But I'm glad that we're seeing a backlash to that because I think that was such a big part of the 2010s culture. Whereas like if I'm a woman, that means I'm a girl boss.And anything a woman does that makes it inherently empowering. Or anytime a YouTuber does something shitty, it's like, but I'm just trying to spread positivity.",
        "Rebecca: I, I remember Taylor Swift's fans had a tantrum because Pitchfork rated her  album like a 7.0, which is like a pretty decent score. or Mr. Beast getting criticism for, this is a very recent example. Um, he made a video. Where it was like, I just cured a thousand people of blindness gonna be crazy. Most of us see the world like this. But, here’s the thing… two hundred million people see the world… like this.and people sort of accused him for using disabled people for profit and for like charity porn.And of course, you know, the Mr. Beast stands and Mr. Beast himself were very frustrated by that. And were kind of screaming on the internet about how he can't do anything, right? People just wanna hate, he's just trying to spread positivity. Uh, but we've seen like these celebr. Having these kind of like tantrums online about not getting exactly the kind of reaction that they were intending to or feeling really overly criticized.I feel like it's never been a worse time to be a critic because we're just so easy to attack for being haters.",
        "Rebecca: Exactly. Or you care so much about Pitchfork that like, that feels like a big  enough slight to Taylor Swift who is, you know, 20 times the amount of influence that Pitchfork does her and you know, Nicki Minaj fans are often cited and.",
        "Rebecca: Have you really? Have you been canceled by Nicki Minaj fans as Barbs? ",
        "Rebecca: You're safe, ",
        "Rebecca: And I think so much of this boils down to this very, very, very popular internet  meme that is, side note, has been totally divorced from its original context, but it's a web comic from a few years ago where someone walks into. a room with a bunch of people watching like a football game or something, and the person is kind of like making little jabs about like how stupid football is.And the last frame of the comic is just some guy like shutting his mouth and he's just like, shhhh let people enjoy things. And that's obviously the part that has gone Mega, mega, mega viral. Where to use a really hacky example like the M C U, the Marvel Cinematic Universe. You know, you can tweet something like barely critical of it and someone can reply with that image of saying, shhh let people enjoy things.Like, how dare you. Like as if that's like, you know, this unforgivable crime. Having the same energy of walking into a room of football fans and being like, you guys like this. You know, those are two completely different things.",
        "Rebecca: Right. And I, I talk about this all the time, or I think about it all the time where,  There is such a difference between the kind of conversations we have or even can have in person in social or professional settings and on the internet. So it's like, of course you wouldn't walk into a room full of super super M C U nerds and say, actually, I don't really like whatever, because you're limited by like time and space and like social norms and things like that.Whereas on the internet it's like, You can go wherever you want. You can find places where people are shit talking the M C U, you can find places where people are obsessed with it, but like what someone says on your corner of the internet has nothing to do with what's happening on the other corner. And the worst part of social media is certain platforms get too big and then all those rooms are like shoved into the same one.And so when you see conversations happening on one side, you take that as like someone invading your space where like, it's everyone's space. You know, it's, it's not just yours. We don't have the limits of physical space to like keep us all in separate areas. It makes people feel attacked when people are just having private conversations or like semi-private.",
        "Rebecca: yeah, totally. I think people carry resentments forever and it can be really difficult  to separate, you know, your own past experiences with being torn down by someone who hates what you have to say and, and not repeating that process over and over again with the same kind of dynamic. Like I, I totally understand why people feel so personally attacked when something that they love is criticized.But some people like the critic, uh, Christian Lorenzen. See the power that fans have over traditional outlets of criticism as kind of a disaster. Like if the New York Review of books starts worrying about backlash to their reviews, then is the act of reviewing itself compromised? What do you think about that?",
        "Rebecca: Right. I think there's a sense on, on our end of the industry that like, if you're  gonna write a pan, it better be worth it. You better be punching up versus punching down, which is, you know, a common concept in journalism where, you know, if you wanna be really critical of something, think about the power that you as a journalist have over the target.And I, I think anyone can agree that Taylor Swift has more power than me or Vox as a whole probably. And so, you know, like any punching up I'm doing, it's like a tiny little poke in the universe of feelings. But I think the internet tends to flatten all that. So when people see like, Journalist with a blue check writing something negative.They think that that's like some really powerful person using their enormous power when like it's just a person that works at a website that probably is making no money.",
        "Rebecca: Yeah. Oh my gosh. Yes. ",
        "Rebecca: this you ",
        "Rebecca: Totally. I see this play out everywhere, whether you're talking about like urban  planning or Oscar films and it, it feels very like, not to be like all cancel culture or whatever, but like when people talk about intellectual ideas or concepts or art, especially, People have started to kind of use the language of social justice to bolster their own opinions, making you know, your consumption of art or your own like personal philosophies as though that's like a moral judgment on your character.And I find that very fascinating and also very harmful to social justice causes.",
        "Rebecca: Yeah. Oh my ",
        "Rebecca: Exactly. ",
        "Rebecca: way of putting it, ",
        "Rebecca: So I actually had this really interesting conversation in an article that I wrote  recently. It was. In defensive haters. Um, she is Talia Lichtstein. She's a TikToker. She's in like an her early twenties living in New York. She's very much like N yc TikTok, girly, but her kind of self branding is like spread negativity with a heart emoji, and she's actually a really smart, really lovely, not like this mean, nasty person.But her whole thing is that we've lived on the internet where everyone just says that they're spreading positivity regardless of what they're doing. Everyone has to love everything. And her thing is she, you know, she just does videos about like, what I hate. And a lot of it is, you know, like anti-feminist stuff, like Andrew Tate.A lot of it is just like, I hate when like couples do this thing on Instagram and I think that stuff is so fun and we need more room for just like mild social critique, which I, again, like this is what artists do, but she was saying how so much of the internet is, is kind of divided into in between like, you know, haters and fans.She was like, I think there's some power in just being like, well, yeah, I'm a hater, but like, I'm also like injecting nuance into this conversation that was never there before. And if you wanna call me a hater, like that's fine too. I'll call myself that. Um, and wear it proudly.",
        "Rebecca: Yeah. I think they're learning. I think the kids are ",
        "Rebecca: Yes. ",
        "Rebecca: Oh my God, it's yes. ",
        "Rebecca: I know it's, it's such, my editor and I talk about this a lot. How, like we, yeah. We  live in fear. Whenever we put up a story, you know, there's, we go through and think about everything that could be taken out of context or something that could just be like blown out into something that it was never meant to be or didn't include someone's.Personal perspective, and it's like, no, it's, it's written by me, it's my perspective. And like if a writer could just like write everyone's experience at at once, it would be the worst thing you've ever read. Like",
        "Rebecca: just be like absolute garbage. So yeah, I think that's a really great point, how it  makes worse writing and in less interesting conversations, because I think when people just see two extreme sides fighting about something, it makes them less likely to wanna engage at all and like less interested in the whole thing.",
        "Rebecca: Exactly. ",
        "Rebecca: I know. ",
        "Rebecca: mmhmm. Right now, it's like whenever there's tension or conflict on one corner of  the internet, the rest of the internet seizes on it because we love stories about like niche conflict. People are just like thirsty for any kind of interesting interpersonal tension. And so these things get. So much bigger than they should be.I read about this a lot when it comes to like canceling normal people. Some random person, you know, he ghosted a couple girls and now he's, you know, his life is kind of ruined because the entire internet was like, oh, this is interesting, look at how shitty he was. This reminds me of like my ex-boyfriend, and so let's like destroy him.",
        "Rebecca: Yeah, because look, ultimately all those people are strangers on a screen and it's  really hard to separate when you're, you're one person, but all these other people you know, seem to be so much more powerful than you.",
        "Rebecca: Yeah. ",
        "Rebecca: Yeah, exactly. ",
        "Rebecca: Right. I feel like haters are more in the like, all right, I'm gonna opt out of this  because I don't like it. You know? Hating is just like, that's not for me. I hate it. For me, it's fine for you, whatever.",
        "Rebecca: Do you think being a hater is in some way an act of love because of how much  kind of time slash attention that you could possibly be throwing it?",
        "Rebecca: Here's an example that is extremely close to your life, but a couple years ago, my  boyfriend wrote an article about the Bill Simmons subreddit and how the entire thing is basically devoted to like hating on Bill Simmons, even though like these people listen to him every day, for like minimum an hour.I have to hear Bill Simmons talk in my apartment all the time, and I'm like, you love them?",
        "Rebecca: Yeah, totally, ",
        "Rebecca: It kind of reminds me of like the way I engage with Bravo reality television, where  it's like, I think Andy Cohen is, you know, a, a pretty horrible person and he is done a lot of horrible things, but like, will I watch anything he produces? Yes. Will I watch all the reunions that he, you know, conducts? Yes.Because in some ways I do love him, but I think it's, yeah, it's, it's. It's complicated, and I think that's what we're all, that's what we're all talking about, how things can be complicated and they don't have to be purely hate and purely fan. ",
        "Rebecca: So when you were saying, you know, the internet is decided, all dissent is  catastrophic, do you worry at all about the consequences of this on the internet or offline? Like do you think that in the future people will have to sort of rediscover this kind of like meaningful non performative dissent? Or is this just like a blip that no one should be worrying about at all?",
        "Rebecca: At a certain point, like, things just become kind of background noise. You know?  It's like…it used to be that like getting a death threat on Twitter was like, oh my God, that is crazy. And now it's like, okay, . You know what I",
        "Rebecca: It's so true. But like, I feel like it'll kind of go that way where it's like, you know,  you're gonna have the, the people at 11 over. and they're just gonna do their thing and didn kind of go on ignoring them. And I really hope that that's where we're going because we're at the point where like, yeah, you can kind of ignore a death threat on Twitter.It's, it's horrible and it sucks, but that's such a small percentage of the human condition and like they're just irrelevant. You know? Like I think that we could get to a place where super duper extreme or, you know, bizarre takes or pronouncements on social media can just. be mass ignored. They don't have to blow up into their own little whole thing where we have to like make someone the main character on Twitter because they tweeted something stupid.They can just be ignored. I hope that's what happens. ",
        "Rebecca: I mean, so one question. We talked a lot about, you know, influencer brain or  YouTuber brain where you know, you as a creator or an influencer or even just like a person online are sort of subject to the whims of what the most amount of people that follow you want to see.Do you ever find yourself having that, um, or do you think the publications you work for feel that way? What's your experience with that?",
        "Rebecca: This is my entire life. ",
        "Rebecca: Good luck YouTubers, have fun. Figure it out.  Okay, Justin, this was very fun and I loved this conversation. I am not a hater of this conversation at all.",

        "INTRO: Hi, I'm Sigal Samuel…. sitting in today for Sean Illing. CLIPS:SBF is like the Jordan Belfort of the crypto eraSBFSBFSBF So yeah, he is facing some very serious charges In the early morning hours of November 11th it all came to an end. S…B…F. You may have heard those initials swirling around recently. They stand for Sam Bankman-Fried, a now-former billionaire who’s at the center of a huge scandal. This past November, his crypto exchange FTX imploded when he lost at least $1 billion in client money after covertly transferring the money to a hedge fund he owned. In December, he was arrested on charges of wire fraud, securities fraud, , money laundering, and more. He pled not guilty to all of them.And this month… In January, he…launched a Substack…. which so far seems mostly about explaining how this whole crypto debacle happened. But crypto is not.. why I’m interested in SBF. I’m interested because of the major role he’s played in.. effective altruism — a newish social movement that’s all about using reason and evidence to do the most good for the most people. SBF was one of its brightest stars.. and biggest funders. Yet now…. it looks like he’s done a lot of bad to a lot of people. He’s obliterated the savings of countless customers. He’s also screwed over a lot of charities he’d promised to fund. And for transparency, I should note: In August 2022, Bankman-Fried’s philanthropic family foundation, Building a Stronger Future, awarded Vox’s Future Perfect a grant for a 2023 reporting project. That project is now on pause.So, this is a crucible moment for effective altruism. Its members had spent a lot of time thinking about how to do good in the world. They thought they’d found a great answer. Now, they’re rethinking their convictions… and they're asking themselves: Did the logic of effective altruism itself produce this bad outcome? Or was effective altruism just part of the scam? And…even more important…Can the movement be redeemed?  ID: I’m Sigal Samuel… and this… is The Gray Area. My guest today is Holden Karnofsky. He’s seen as a leader in the world of effective altruism, or EA for short. And his personal story kinda parallels the story of EA writ large.To give you a preview, it goes like this:  the movement's evolved from one that's about helping people in the here and now… mainly poor people in poor countries with problems like malaria and intestinal parasites….  To a movement that's pretty interested in the long-term future of humanity… like how to prevent our species from getting wiped out by rogue artificial intelligence.I want to know – does Holden think effective altruism should go back to its original focus on helping people in the here and now — sort of EA 1.0?OR does it still make sense to focus on the long-term stuff that typified EA 2.0? But most of all– given everything we've learned after the SBF scandal —  I want to find out: What should EA 3.0 look like? Hi, Holden. Thank you so much for joining us on the show. Holden Karnofsky: Yeah, thanks for having me.Sigal: So when the SBF scandal broke on a scale from one to 10, how surprised were you with  one being? Yep. This was entirely foreseeable, and 10 being I am completely flabbergasted. Oh my God, how the hell could this possibly have happened?",
        "Sigal: Okay. I mean, effective altruism is a pretty tight-knit community. You know, there's  regular conferences and meetings and conversations. So to what extent did you and SBF know each other? Were you friendly? Did you talk much?",
        "Sigal: What was your general impression of him? I'm just kind of curious, was your impression,  this is a really scrupulous guy who sincerely wants to do a ton of good for the world or what?",
        "Sigal: SBF kind of grew up on effective altruism. So when he was in college, he had this kind of  fateful lunch with Will McCaskill, the moral philosopher who's probably the closest thing that EA has to a leader. And over lunch, SBF said that he wanted to devote his career to animal welfare, actually, but Will McCaskill convinced him he could make a bigger impact by choosing a career that would just make a ton of money and then donating all that money. So, you know, lo and behold, SBF pursues a career in finance and then crypto, and he starts pouring funding into all of these EA causes. But for you, I have the sense that the path was sort of different.So tell me how you became involved with effective altruism, what your initial feelings were about it. Were there some aspects that kind of weirded you out?",
        "Sigal: I personally see you as a leader in the effective altruism world. Is that fair to say? Would  you identify as that, or do you see yourself differently?",
        "Sigal: Right. So in terms of the aspects of effective altruism that maybe slightly weirded you out  or you were slightly not super comfortable with, one thing that comes to mind for me, pretty obviously is utilitarianism. Let's start by establishing this. In the simplest terms to you. What does utilitarianism as an ethical theory entail?",
        "Sigal: Okay, great. So let's get into that in a second. But I just wanna say, you know, like this  general idea of try to produce the greatest good for the greatest number, like try to maximize the overall good. At first, that sounds kind of nice, you know, but it can lead to a really weird ends justify the means kind of mentality.There's one famous thought experiment that comes to mind for me, which is, If a patient shows up at a hospital, is it maybe the right thing to do to just cut him up and take all his organs since by killing him, you can potentially save the lives of five other people who need organs. Right? So the utilitarian, if they're pretty hardcore about their utilitarianism, might come and say, yes, cut up that one person, ‘cause you can save five other people.And I'm just curious, you know, do you think that this style of thinking might have led SBF astray? As in, he might have thought, okay, it's fine to do this alleged fraud because he can make billions of dollars that way and then donate it all to amazing charities?",
        "Sigal: That “weird interview” by the way was with Vox’s Kelsey Piper, and it was conducted,  funnily enough, over Twitter DMs. We’ll put a link to that in the show notes.",
        "Sigal: Well, whether or not SBF personally was motivated by utilitarianism to have this ends  justify the means mentality, and that's kind of what motivated this alleged fraud – beyond just the SBF question, thinking about EA generally, has EA leaned too hard into utilitarianism? I know that EA and utilitarianism are not one and the same.But I think it's fair to say that there is like a pretty strong flavor of utilitarianism among a lot of top EA thinkers. And I wonder if you think that creates a big risk that members will be kind of likely to apply this philosophy in naive, harmful, ends justify the means kind of ways.",
        "Sigal: Right. I mean, I am glad you mentioned this blog post because, yeah, that was a couple  months before the SBF scandal broke, and I think it was very prescient, especially that part where you say if you're maximizing X, you're asking for trouble by default. EA says it's about maximizing the good, but that's, like, something we're very conceptually confused about.So this seems like it's gonna kind of set us up for trouble. And you say, by default it seems like a recipe for trouble. Do you kind of feel now that your warning was basically vindicated by what happened with SBF?Sigal: Yeah. But do you feel like, damn, I got that right. ",
        "Sigal: Like you should have listened to your own inner voice? ",
        "Sigal: So are you kind of saying that maximize the good is a recipe for disaster? ",
        "Sigal: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Sigal: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Sigal: The picture that I hear you painting… it kind of sounds like the way you're laying it out,  EA and utilitarianism are not coextensive. They're not the same thing. There's maybe a bit of a Venn diagram thing going on here where EA and utilitarianism have a fair bit of overlap, but they're somewhat different.I wanna put before you a slightly different possible way to read the EA movement. A few smart guys like Will McCaskill and, and some others, at Oxford especially, who wanted to help the world and give to charity basically looked around at the philanthropy landscape and thought, you know, this seems kind of dumb.People are donating millions of dollars to their alma maters, like to Harvard or Yale, when obviously that money could do a lot more good if you used it to help, I don't know, poor people in Kenya. And they realized basically that the charity world could use more utilitarian-style thinking, but then they over-corrected and started bringing that utilitarian mindset to everything, and that over-correction is now more or less EA.What would you say about a reading like that?",
        "Sigal: From your blog post about EA and maximizing, it sounds like you would like to see EA  embrace a little more of the common sense moral rules, deontology vibe, right?It seems like you would like to see more moral pluralism, if I could put it that way, a little bit more embrace of other moral theories, not only utilitarianism. Is that fair to say?",
        "Sigal: So when you started out in your career, you were a lot more focused on very present day  problems, like global poverty, global health, you know, the classic EA concerns, but then ea. Sort of how to pivot towards long-termism, which more or less is the idea that we should really, really prioritize positively influencing the long-term future of humanity, thousands, even millions of years from now.Tell me the story of how you gradually became more convinced of long-termism.",
        "Sigal: Sure. ",
        "Sigal: So I'm glad you're bringing that up because this ties back to our earlier conversation  about utilitarianism. I feel like that can be tricky enough when you're just looking at the world today, but when you add in the long-term future, it can just really go bonkers, right? And this is one of the common critiques of long-termism, that it's all about maximizing overall expected value, but that can lead you to pretty ludicrous conclusions. So, it sounds like that freaks you out and you feel like that might be going astray. Is that right?",
        "Sigal: This is kind of what I meant when I said if you go further along this line of thinking, it just  goes really bonkers. So without going into infinite worlds and all of that fun craziness, just to like really show that this is a very concrete issue you're probably dealing with every day when you show up at work.This comes up in your work at Open Philanthropy because you guys have millions of dollars to give away. You have to decide what to spend it on. And, if you say, for example, I think there's a 0.0001% chance trillions of future humans will never get to exist because rogue AI wipes out all of humanity – well, then if you're just focused on maximizing expected value, You might decide to just spend all your money on AI safety and $0 on helping people who are poor today, but like that seems weird. So at Open Phil., you guys use a method that's called worldview diversification to decide how to divvy up money to different causes.So, tell me how worldview diversification works.",
        "Sigal: Personally, I'm very glad that Open Philanthropy does worldview diversification. It just  seems wise to kind of hedge your bets intellectually that way, and to not become so single-minded about just maximizing one thing, whether that's animal welfare or future people coming to be alive in millions of years or whatever.And this has me just thinking about how, in EA circles, there's this fear that's commonly talked about: the idea that we’ll inadvertently design AI that is a single-minded optimizing machine. And doing whatever it takes to achieve a goal, but in a way that's not necessarily aligned with values that we approve of.And so the paradigmatic funny example here is we design an AI and we say your one function is to make as many paperclips as possible. We wanna maximize the number of paperclips. And we think like, okay, cool, that's a fine goal. AI will do a fine job of that. But then, the AI doesn't have our human values. It's just an AI program to do one thing, and so it goes and does crazy stuff to get as many paperclips as possible. And that could mean, colonizing the world and the whole universe to gather as much matter as possible and turn all matter, including people, into paperclips, right? Like it could really go crazy.So that's just a bit of a tongue in cheek example, but I think this core fear that you hear a lot in EA about a way that AI could go really wrong if it's a single-minded optimizing machine. Do you think that some effective altruists have basically become the thing that they're scared AI will be? Single-minded optimizing machines?",
        "Sigal: I'm glad you used the word projection in terms of the question of whether EAs have  maybe projected onto AI, uh, a little bit of what they themselves might be doing. I think there might be a little grain of truth there.",
        "Sigal: Let's think about this. What reforms do you wanna see in EA, if any? What would it look  like for EA to seriously engage with these critiques we've been talking about, and then use them to become more sound, both as a philosophy and as a social movement?",
        "Sigal: I wanna pick up on that, because for me personally, I see a little bit of tension between  two things I've seen from you. On the one hand, you know, you sound like you really have this embrace of moral pluralism and you, I think correctly, want to see different moral theories taken seriously, appreciated for the moral intuitions that are actually genuinely important maybe, and they're capturing something real. We should pay attention. And you are well aware of and have pointed out and written about how a view that encourages us to maximize just one thing exclusively can be really risky and perilous. I've also seen you write about how you're bothered by ethics that's based on common sense intuitions and societal norms, because that does have a terrible track record like, people used to think that slavery was ethically fine. ",
        "Sigal: And so you have developed this idea of future-proof ethics. So, a theory that'll stand the  test of time, so that we're acting now in ways that people would still approve of in, let's say a hundred, 200 years. But to me, that requires some clear moral rules or some systemization.And it seems to me like any systemizing moral theory, whether it's utilitarianism or something else, is going to encourage us to maximize one thing exclusively, and if we want to not get into trouble with that, we maybe have to give up on the seductive dream of finding one tidy rule or clear cut thing that we're always just optimizing for.And I wonder if you feel ready to bite that bullet.",
        "Sigal: I mean, I think another way to read this ambivalence is to read it as an indicator that this  whole endeavor of science-y maximizing for ethics is, is kind of a category mistake. And that this sort of systematizing science-y language of making something future-proof in terms of ethics really relies on a kind of moral realism, right? It’s the idea that there are objective moral truths and…",
        "Sigal: Okay. ",
        "Sigal: I mean, I think personally the way I square the circle is to just acknowledge that the very  notion of moral progress, and like what is morality, is to some degree historically contingent, culturally conditioned, and I'm fine with that. But I know that your mileage may vary.",
        "Sigal: I do wanna get to some other more concrete questions here about the future of EA. One  of them is about funding. I think that's a pretty important one. A bunch of EA's critics had warned that the movement's funding needs to be more decentralized. I know that the Oxford scholar, Carla Cremer, for example, she argued that the movement should allow for more bottom up control over how the funding is distributed, and actively fund critical work.Do you agree that EA needs more of that?",
        "Sigal: I mean, I think another way into this is talking about different kinds of diversity here and  cultivating that even within these organizations that do have currently a lot of the money and power and you know, I think it's fair to say that so far EA has been largely a white men with fancy college degrees kind of space. And so one of the structural reforms that's been proposed for EA is to cultivate more intellectual diversity and to really democratize how the ideas get evaluated instead of just relying on this very over-centralized kind of power structure where a few very elite and unrepresentative voices are the ones that get heard.Do you think that that's on point?",
        "Sigal: To sort of make this a little bit more concrete and think about what it could look like in  practice to take this on board. So the scholars Carla Cremer and Luke Kemp have thought about this and they've advocated for effective altruists to use, maybe more deliberative styles of decision making. So something like citizens assemblies, where you get a group of randomly selected citizens.You present them with facts, they debate, and they arrive at a decision together. We've already seen that kind of assembly in the context of deciding climate policy and abortion policy. Would you like to see EA be democratic in a similar way?",
        "Sigal: You know, EA isn't just a pure philosophy in the ivory tower, even though we've spent a  lot of time talking about utilitarianism, et cetera. It's also, I would say an ideology, it's a social movement. It's a subculture, it's an identity. What do you wanna say, to the many young effective altruists who kind of built their whole identities around EA in some cases and really took EA ideas as gospel, and are now feeling maybe kind of let down and shaken in their faith post-SBF?",
        "Sigal: You see that though, right? ",
        "Sigal: You see that among, especially some young — ",
        "Sigal: My one gripe with that would be, I don't know if it's quite fair to say that's the core idea to  effective altruism, because it's not just, and we've talked about this, but it's not just the simple phrasing of “do a lot of good. That's cool.” It's “do the most good possible,” and I suspect that that being built into the foundations might be what drives a lot of particularly young, idealistic people to feel like they need to push it, push it, push it to the max, right? Because “push it to the max” is built into the DNA of the ideology, whereas I, what I actually hear you saying is something far more nuanced. I like that nuance and that nuance is something I would hope to see prevail. ",
        "INTRO: Hi, I'm Sigal Samuel…. sitting in today for Sean Illing. I’m going to be honest. For most of my life, I haven’t really cared that much about animals. I figured I just wasn’t an animal person. Then… the pandemic started. Suddenly there was all this time when I was stuck at home, sitting in front of my window…watching the birds. And I just became completely obsessed with them. I started reading books about how smart birds are — like how crows can solve all these really complex puzzles.A few months later… I went snorkeling for the first time… and I got to meet a couple of octopuses in the sea. They played hide-and-seek with me, camouflaging themselves to try and trick me. Their intelligence wowed me so much that I have no desire to ever eat calamari again. I even met a pod of dolphins, and their curiosity and playfulness were so palpable to me that I felt a bond right away. what about other animals that aren’t as obviously smart (at least from a human perspective)? If they’re conscious… or even just alive…. do they deserve just as much of my concern? And beyond whether animals seem like us… what about their relationship to us – Does it matter if they live around us humans or in the wild? If an antelope somewhere in the African savannah is suffering from some antelope disease, that’s not the kind of thing I need to do something about…is it?ID: I’m Sigal Samuel… and this… is The Gray Area. HOT:My guest today is Martha Nussbaum. If I were to list all the books she’s written and prizes she’s won, it would probably take up this whole episode. So I’m just gonna say this: She’s a very, very big deal in the philosophy world. Like, a big enough deal that her essays were required reading in my philosophy classes in undergrad. She’s taught at Harvard and Oxford, and now she teaches ethics and law at the University of Chicago. But Martha is not one of those ivory tower philosophers whose ideas just sit in a dusty book on some shelf. She wants her ideas to change laws in the real world. Typically she’s focused on laws that affect humans. But her daughter Rachel, who made a career working for the rights of animals, got her to care more and more about this issue over the years. Rachel died in 2019, and as an act of what she calls constructive mourning, Martha just wrote a new book called “Justice for Animals.” The goal of the book is to present a revolutionary new theory about what we human beings owe animals. But Martha started by telling me about the old theories and why she doesn’t think they’re good enough. Martha Nussbaum: So first of all, there's a very dominant theory, which is used in law right now. It's, used by the non-human rights project. Steven Wise is a, a very fine lawyer for animal rights, and he follows the traditional idea of a ladder of nature where humans are at the top. But he thinks that there are few animals, particularly great apes, but also whales and elephants, that are enough like humans to deserve to count as persons in law. Now, let me say that I don't think that's the whole of what's on his mind as a human being – but as a lawyer, this is what he thinks he can get judges to care about. So, you know, he thinks that where the world is, is that we care more about animals that seem more like us.Now, first of all, I think there's a lot of empirical gaps in his theory because, I mean, nature doesn't present a single ladder. It presents remarkable horizontal complexity. There are animals who have senses that we totally lack, like birds. They can navigate by perceiving magnetic fields, which is something we can't do. Dolphins can figure out what's inside an object by echo location, which we cannot do. And second, it's just the wrong reason to care about doing justice to another creature, that it's like us. I think that would be a bad reason if it was another human being. And of course a lot of people do think that the fact that a certain group is more like us ethnically or religiously or so on, is a reason to treat that group better. But we, I think we can recognize that as a bad reason. But with animals, I think we need to recognize that as a bad reason. Our reasons should be because of what is happening to them, not because they're like us.And so then, the biggest problem is that he has absolutely nothing to say about the terrible sufferings of animals that he deems not sufficiently like us. That is to say, all birds, most vertebrates, all invertebrates.And so the worst horrors that I feel we need to deal with immediately are the sufferings of animals that we raise for food in the factory farming industry. He has nothing to say about that. So that to me makes the theory a real non-starter.And it seems to me that ladder of nature approach, which goes back many  centuries, the Scala Natura approach, this idea that animal species are arranged in this hierarchy with humans at the top, closest to God. Typically it's, how people think of that is the ones at the top are ones we imagine to be very intelligent or have this capacity for rationality. And I think like more recent animal science from people like the primatologist Frans de Waal, has really shown us that every species actually has its own brand of smarts, as you were saying with dolphins and echolocation, or how birds navigate.It's just that each species has its own brand of smarts that are adapted to its specific needs and its specific environment. Right? ",
        "Sigal: So tell me about the next approach that you explore, which is the utilitarian approach.  I know that, you know, philosophers from Jeremy Bentham all the way through to Peter Singer today have really popularized this one. ",
        "Sigal: Right. So I mean, utilitarianism on the one hand, it seems like it moved us forward  somewhat because, you know, I kind of like that Bentham said, the right question for us to ask about animals is not, can they reason, but can they suffer? Like, that seems like a helpful intervention in the conversation.But focusing just on suffering or pain and pleasure as this single calculus also kind of brings up these issues that you're mentioning – and it sounds like at the end there you were kind of getting at the issue of like, it sort of reduces every creature, whether a human or animal, to just this container that is sort of interchangeable with all other containers. We're all just vessels that can contain this many units of pleasure or pain. As opposed to a more Kantian approach, right? So this is another approach you talk about in your book, an approach inspired by Immanuel Kant, who famously insisted that we shouldn't treat others as a means to an end. They each have dignity, they're an end in themselves. And it seems like you really like that idea. But when it comes to contemporary philosophers like Christine Korsgaard, who've tried to use Kant to build up a theory of what we owe animals, you ultimately reject that approach too. Why is that?",
        "Sigal: Yeah, it seems like what's really tricky about Korsgaard's position is, she wants to  maintain this very Kanty view, that there's something really special setting us apart from other animals like our rationality.And I actually found it interesting in your book, you write – her position would not be uncomfortable if she simply said, this is the human form of life. And to some extent it is different from other forms of life. All lives are uniquely wonderful in their own way.And like, honestly, that sounds great to me. And I kind of wondered when reading that like, great, why can't that just be the view, just without the Kantian framing of humans are ends or animals are ends. For me personally, it feels like a really weird claim to make about anyone, human, non-human. Because sort of in my way of seeing it, no creature objectively has rights, right? Like this thing called rights is a fictional story that we as humans construct, like rights don't somehow fall from the heavens or emerge from the essence of the creature.And so I'm just trying to understand, do you disagree with that philosophically or do you agree with it philosophically and just use the language of rights because it's a really powerful rhetorical tool, it can be useful in politics and law?",
        "Sigal: I guess I'm just questioning whether it's possible to talk about an ethical reality without  making some kind of controversial metaphysical claim.",
        "Sigal: Now that we've kind of deconstructed some of the competing theories about animals and  kind of shown some of their shortcomings, tell me, if the, 'so like us' approach doesn't cut it, utilitarianism doesn't quite cut it. Kant doesn't really cut it – Tell me about the approach that you think is better and that you're really fleshing out in this book, which is your capabilities approach.",
        "Sigal: Right. So like just spitballing here. The capabilities approach list for, let's say dolphins,  might be, like, basic entitlements – life, health, bodily integrity, ability to swim over like large bodies of water; opportunities for social engagement, opportunities for play – right?",
        "Sigal:  Right. Okay. That makes sense, because for an animal that's sort of evolved  symbiotically with humans, then at this point it might be part of their basic capabilities list to be able to have that interaction with a human, for example.",
        "Sigal: So, I'm kind of curious, like when you're thinking about the capabilities approach, what  would that mean practically. What that would look like practically for the most commonly domesticated animals, pets, but also maybe farmed animals, animals used in research.Are there really sharp ways you think society would need to change to make room for accommodating animals' different capabilities?",
        "Sigal: Yep. Mm-hmm. ",
        "Sigal: Right, those Ag-Gag laws. ",
        "Sigal: So we were talking about the eating of animals and // I'm glad you're mentioning this  because probably the vegetarians and vegans listening to this might have some questions about how the capabilities approach would affect different farmed animals. And in the capabilities approach, you talk about really wanting to preserve the opportunity for animals to be able to strive for what they would naturally strive for.  And you give as an example, you know, eating eggs. I think, if I'm remembering right, you say, if you have a hen who, let's say she has just laid eight eggs. And you take four. And you allow her to keep incubating some. That maybe seems okay, because she's still getting to fulfill her striving.",
        "Sigal: Just to kick the tires on this a little bit, one thing I sort of wonder – some might object to  this idea of, well, it's okay to take some of the eggs because the animal is still getting to fulfill some level of striving.The larger question that raises for me is whether, when we humans are having to make that capabilities list for different animals, I guess we kind of have to be the arbiters of what the essential capabilities are that end up on that list.?",
        "Sigal: Yeah. I wanna pick up on what you were just saying about contraceptives and talk a little  bit about animals in the wild. In your book, you actually go beyond just advocating for us to do more to take good care of companion animals, farmed animals.You entertain this idea of, and defend this idea of actually doing things to help animals in the wild – and you actually complicate that whole idea of the wild. But I just wanna be totally honest with you – when I first encountered this idea a year or two ago, I honestly just thought it was like, laugh out loud, ridiculous. I could get on board with the idea that maybe humans should help animals that they've domesticated, you know, we have some kind of responsibility to them. But there's like a difference between fixing a harm that we as humans have caused, and then like, proactively helping wild animals from, you know, preventing them from getting a disease or even from being eaten.But some people really do make these arguments. And one thing you said in your book actually did really make me think, and it was your point that there's actually no such thing anymore as wild nature, because actually all spaces are under human control, and so we do have that responsibility even to wild animals.Can you just explain how that can be? Is there any wild actually left?",
        "Sigal: Does that mean that even for issues that aren't directly, directly, directly traceable to us,  maybe a population imbalance between species, should we be using contraception to tackle that?",
        "Sigal: Mmmhmm. ",
        "Sigal: This is something I really like about your approach, that it recognizes that we as society  have many different important and irreducible values, and so sometimes they're naturally gonna be in tension with each other. And we're inevitably gonna face tragic dilemmas or trade-offs, sometimes between competing values. And sometimes the best we can do is try to find the path that seems to minimize the pain that would be experienced by, let's say rats. But also that protects what is maybe like a reasonable value for humans, which is not to have pests around that might harm us.",
        "Sigal: So do you think we should intervene in any way when it comes to predators in the wild,  like lions and gazelles being eaten?",

        "Sean: And that origin wound for you? That's the divorce? ",
        "Sean: So what… what drew me to your book is this focus on patterns. Patterns of thought and  patterns of behavior. Obviously, those things are related, and how we get stuck in them, and one of the greatest frustrations in my life at the moment is this feeling of being almost hostage to extremely dumb impulses. Like, I can often see myself doing or saying something in real time, often with my wife.I know it's stupid. I know it's counterproductive. I know it can only escalate a situation, and yet I plow ahead anyway. And there is this maddening feeling of knowing what I should do and not doing it. Maybe you'd call that self-sabotage, maybe you'd call it being a dumbass. I, I don't know. Like, those obviously aren't mutually exclusive.What do you tell people when they experience some version of this? Like, when they just can't quite overcome what they know are terrible impulses?",
        "Sean: Yeah. Well, you know, I don't know where it comes from with me, maybe this will, maybe  this will come out in the context of this conversation. For me, it, it really does feel like this impulse to behave in ways I know are unhealthy, is so strong that it, it can feel like almost a nervous system sort of thing.And I don't wanna accept that because I don't wanna rob myself of agency to do otherwise. But it really does feel like that sometimes. And I don't know if part of it is me almost thriving on conflict, right? Where like I'm choosing, I'm choosing conflict because that almost feels more familiar and safe than actually just choosing to interpret a situation differently that would push in the opposite direction.",
        "Sean: With acting that way? ",
        "Sean: Escalation. ",
        "Sean: Um, in an almost perverse way, I feel almost more comfortable because I'm very much at  ease when my guard is up, like I'm very comfortable fighting. I'm very comfortable arguing. I'm very comfortable attacking and deflecting. It's almost a safer space than being vulnerable, right? And so I just naturally retreat to that.",
        "Sean: You know what… the story it ultimately ends up supporting is that everything is fucked.  And what I mean by that, right? Look, if, if I was on your therapist's couch and I kind of am right now, and you asked me what's the one habit or the one part of my personality that I most want to change, what I would tell you is that I'm a catastrophizer very often, and this is something that I, how should I put this?It's not great for me or my relationships. Right? And for anyone unfamiliar with that term, like what I mean is there is this instinct to almost pre-prepare for disaster by not just imagining all the ways something could go wrong. But actually, like, conjuring reasons to blow it up before it goes wrong.And so anytime I sniff conflict, I just, my mind will immediately go to, oh yeah, of course, right? Because things are messed up and we're broken, and of course this is just validation of all of that. And it, it, it becomes self-fulfilling and it's totally delusional, often.",
        "Sean: Hmm. What does that mean? That sounds right, but. ",
        "Sean: You know, I think fear probably has a lot to do with it. Fear of what exactly I, I can't say, I  mean, maybe you would call it a safety wound that stems from my being an only child from a broken home with very young parents who were trying to figure out how to be parents before they were probably ready to be parents. And so part of it feels very much like a defense mechanism.",
        "Sean: Well, I'm glad you brought up that story. It's about trust, you know, a lack of trust and,  and that's a very common problem in relationships, and it's easy to understand in certain situations like infidelity or something, that's an obvious breach of trust that's very hard to get back. But I think a lack of trust often shows up in much quieter, deeper ways for a lot of us, and that is harder to diagnose.But every bit as consequential. Like for example, like, like maybe, you know, we don't open ourselves up to someone because we're worried about being judged or even more insidious: We assume the worst intentions from our partner for perhaps lots of reasons that have nothing to do with them, that predate them.But seeing someone through that filter of suspicion is such a poison pill for a relationship. And it does kind of boil down to trust. And I guess, you know, if you dig deep enough into the source of all of that, you end up landing in childhood. Not always, but I suspect often.",
        "Sean: You know, I'll be honest, like one of the things I've always found sort of off-putting about  the world of wellness literature is a kind of obsession with self-care and self-fulfillment, you know, taken too far, I do think that can become self-indulgent when often I think what we really need in order to be happy is to be less self-involved.But I think you, you make a pretty compelling case that the absence of self-love manifests in some pretty toxic ways in our relationships. And maybe you could just say a bit about that.",
        "Sean: The question of authenticity, about how as children we often trade our authenticity for  attachment, we start contorting ourselves very early. I certainly did for way longer than I should have for other people because that is the straightest line to acceptance. But that strategy does not work in the long run.I think you're right that it becomes a problem in our relationships, right? I mean, there are, there are, there are many different versions of this. I, I have my own. To not make this all about me. There's a case in the book, it's the gay man from West Virginia who is closeted for years, and he moves to New York City and finds himself in a relationship with someone who's wrapped up in the party scene and he's like playing along, but it's not really what he wants. He wants a quieter life, but he's stuck performing this role because he thinks he has to in order to be accepted by his partner and probably by his social circle. But no one can maintain that kind of pose forever, right?Like we gotta be who we are for the people we love, or they won't be able to love us and we won't be able to love ourselves.",
        "Sean: Hmm. We're both parents. ",
        "Sean: Having a kid is such a transformative event in the life of a couple. Everyone more or less  understands that, but do you think we still underestimate just how much becoming a parent changes our relationships?",
        "Sean: Yeah, I think it really is true on some level that every couple is a story that they sort of  believe together, and that story changes. It has to change, and it certainly changes when you become parents. You know, and I, again, I can only speak from personal experience, but what has happened for us is there's this kind of gradual evolution from being friends who sort of share life together.And if you're not very careful, what you find yourself becoming is less that and more co-managers of a household. And all your energy, and all your bandwidth and all your patience gets used up on this child. You know, especially when, when they're really young. You know, again, we have a three and a half year old and that means there's nothing left for each other, and so you become more reactive and more irritable and you start dumping some of those frustrations onto each other ‘cause there's nowhere else for it to go. And that has been one of the hardest things to reckon with and, and try to transcend. And there ",
        "Sean: Yeah. ",
        "Sean: The worthiness wound prompted a bit of tough reflection. You know, again, I, I was an  only child. There weren't any siblings around, and I think part of the way I responded to that was this feeling of not quite having a tribe, you know, and having parents who were young and not always available. And so I think, the way I— that ended up manifesting for me is I became very sort of chameleonic, you know what I mean? Like I became very good at trying to fit in.",
        "Sean: Yeah. With as many different people as I could in order to, I don't know, get validation or  just feel like I was part of a tribe. And you do that long enough and eventually you realize… oh, I never really actually settled my identity. I just kept playing with new ones in order to fit with the circumstances in which I found myself. That was a big revelation for me.",
        "Sean: Oh yeah. ",
        "Sean: So if you were someone who is finding themselves stuck in some of these patterns of  reactivity and you, you want to disrupt that pattern, is there any other concrete advice you can give people a, a practice or tool that they can draw on when they find themselves slipping into another one of these patterns and just kind of doing the same dance over and over again?",

I just said, you know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna walk away. What I'm not gonna do is escalate, right? I can't quite resolve this, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna just put a bow on this whole exchange.Walk away. Then we could circle back later. But I can see that if I'm gonna keep participating in what's happening here, uh, I'm gonna do it in a way that's gonna make this worse, not better. So I'm just gonna, that's it. I'm gonna end it.

I guess I'm trying to make a point, you know, like… if that were to happen, What I know, absol– what I know more than anything I've ever known in my whole life is that I would never forgive myself for having wasted the time we had on such ridiculous, trivial nonsense that will appear so trivial and ridiculous less than 24 hours later.",

        "INTRO: CLIP: passage from Nietzsche’s Ecce Homo VO:I know my fate. Some day my name will be linked to the memory of something monstrous, of a crisis as yet unprecedented on earth, the most profound collusion of consciences, a decision conjured up against everything hitherto believed, demanded, hallowed. I am not a man… I am dynamite.Those are the words of Friedrich Nietzsche… Nietzsche’s philosophy has been a  huge influence in my life. If you listen to the show, you already know that. But the guy is full of contradictions.He’s in the rare echelon of philosophers who've managed to cross over into popular culture. CLIP: from Little Miss Sunshine:STEVE CARRELL: Is that Nietzsche? You don’t speak because of Friedrich Nietzsche? … Far out.That’s from Little Miss Sunshine, an Oscar-winning 2006 movie. For a 19th century German philosopher, that’s pretty mainstream…And yet, when it comes to his actual philosophy — his ideas are hard to pin down. He wrote in many different voices and in many different (and often contradictory) ways ….Nietzsche challenged readers to live heroically … To transcend the banalities of a sick, decadent culture … The irony of course is that he himself was very sick … And near the end of his life, while staying in Italy… he suffered a full mental breakdown.He never recovered.The contradictions pile up in Nietzsche’s work, too. In books like Beyond Good & Evil, he tosses away most of traditional morality …   But he’s also trying to warn us about why this is such a catastrophe for civilization… That has something to do with what he called “the death of God,” and trust me, we’ll get into that later.He’s notorious for the concept of the Übermensch — or “Super-man”... this is an idea the Nazis would later borrow to suit their own sordid political goals … And while it’s never entirely clear what Nietzsche meant by that word, it’s obvious it had nothing to do with antisemitism or eugenics.So, Nietzsche is a bit of a mystery … But he is, without question, a radical and inspiring thinker, someone who anticipated some of our modern crises better than anyone else … And yet, because of how he wrote (and often what he wrote), he can, in the hands of a certain kind of reader, lead to some dark places…But… he remains an essential thinker for our time, … And it’s up to us to resolve the contradictions.music ID: I’m Sean Illing… and this… is The Gray Area.music My guest today is Matt McManus. He’s a lecturer at the University of Michigan, and he’s the editor of a new essay collection, called Nietzsche and the Politics of Reaction.As McManus reads him, Nietzsche is a political thinker – and a right-wing one, at that. He says, if we want to really understand Nietzsche, we’re going to have to grapple with that fact. McManus thinks that Nietzsche is the ultimate reactionary, and in that respect he thinks that we can use Nietzsche to understand our politics today. And so I wanted to talk to him about how this weird, brilliant, singular philosopher can shed light not just on the far right – but on progressives, too.But… in order to do that, we’re gonna have to take Nietzsche seriously… and confront what he has to say, even when we don’t like what he’s saying.music Matt McManus, welcome to the show. ",
        "Sean: I think a Nietzsche episode is long overdue for this show. This one is tough for me  because I love Nietzsche. I mean, he's one of the great intellectual influences of my life, and I continue to think he understood the crisis of modernity better and sooner than anyone, and yet there is this dark side to Nietzsche, and if you take him too far too seriously, it can lead to some pretty ugly places.We'll get into what I mean by that, but I just wanted to kind of throw my cards on the table right at the start of this thing.",
        "Sean: I mean, come on, dude. That's so cliche. ",
        "Sean: Did Nietzsche cause the crisis or, or was the crisis well underway by the time you  happened upon him?",
        "Sean: Yeah, that's the thing about Nietzsche, right? From page to page, you can swing from, oh  my God, that's the most brilliant insight I've ever encountered. And then on the next page it's like… ooh, yikes. Did he really just say that?",
        "Sean: Yeah. You know, you, you edited this anthology of essays about Nietzsche and you've  just completed a monograph that is at least partly about Nietzsche.",
        "Sean: So what's the motivation there? Why do you think we need to engage with someone like  Nietzsche at this political moment?",
        "Sean: Yeah. You know, the idea that Nietzsche was anti-political or apolitical was always so  bizarre to me. I mean, it's true. He spends a lot of time fretting about culture, but for him, culture and politics are very clearly bound up with one another. And so his concerns about culture are very much tethered to his concerns about politics.So you just simply can't separate those things out.",
        "Sean: Oh yeah. ",
        "Sean: It may help to set the table a little bit for the rest of the conversation to just ask you how  people have interpreted Nietzsche over the years. He wasn't terribly well-known when he was alive and writing, and he died in 1900. Then he, he ends up getting appropriated by the Nazis for sordid reasons that we don't have to get into here.And then later in the 20th century, he becomes a kind of radical proto-postmodern progressive darling. I mean, is it possible to give us some of the broad strokes here in terms of how he has been read over the years? Why has this guy had so many philosophical lives?",
        "Sean: And super quickly – what’s philology, for those of us who don’t know? ",
        "Sean: And we could just say, just, just real quickly, Walter Kaufmann is the sort of foremost  translator of Nietzsche for American audiences.",
        "Sean: Yeah, he's not fascist. He's just a little weird. ",
        "Sean: So let's get into the ideas. As you point out, Nietzsche is one of those rare philosophers  who has managed to enter into the pop cultural imagination. That's partly why so many people have opinions about him, despite having never read him. And the thing I hear the most about Nietzsche is he's the guy who was a nihilist, who gleefully pronounced that God is dead.That trope triggers the hell out of me. I, I don't know about you, Matt, but we should clear this up right now because I think understanding this part of his thought, what he actually meant here, is really essential to making sense of everything else that comes out of his mouth later. So what did Nietzsche mean by God is dead?",
        "Sean: I mean, that's sort of what's so ironic here, right? Like when, when Nietzsche is talking  about the death of God, it's really a lamentation. You know, he's saying like, yo, yo people, do you see what we've done here? Do you understand the crisis this is going to unleash? We are absolutely not prepared for what is about to happen – or for what has already happened, actually.It's so different from this notion that he was sort of dancing on God's grave.",
        "Sean: Yeah, he has this startling line. And like so many of his lines, it packs so much into a few  words. He writes, ever since Copernicus man has been rolling away from the center toward X, it's getting at this idea that humanity's self-understanding of its place in the cosmos, right? Our understanding of our own creaturely significance… that starts to melt away with Copernicus, when we realize we're actually not the center of things. And then it finally gets extinguished by Darwin when we realize, oh, we're just a random product of blind, impersonal forces. And that is a gigantic event in human history.",
        "Sean: So if God is dead wasn't a celebration, and it wasn’t, Nietzsche wasn't a champion of  nihilism. He was. He was diagnosing it. So in terms of the story we want to tell here about his legacy, why was the death of God such a cataclysmic political event for him? Like, why did he think we really need to grapple with this?",
        "Sean: Right. So, it's this idea that our whole notion of, of absolute moral truth was tethered to  God. So the real problem wasn't that, everyone is now suddenly on the road to atheism. The problem for him is that we are still clinging to these absolute values about good and evil, about, as you were saying, the fundamental equality of human beings.But the foundations for these original claims had dropped out beneath us.",
        "Sean: And it is worth saying that the claim here wasn't that there could be no morality or truth  without God. He’s saying the moral order that shaped our civilization that had collapsed. And that was a political crisis as much as anything else. And this is so important for Nietzsche, partly because he thinks it reopens this question of what humanity actually is.And he's trying to force this confrontation with this crisis. And given how the 20th Century unfolded, it is unnerving to revisit some of his predictions about, you know, quote wars to determine the future of mankind, right? Like, the destruction of established religion for him wasn't the end of religion.This is the beginning of nihilism. Nihilism was what happens when our, to use his language, our highest values, lose their value, lose their ground. And that sort of sets us adrift in this, in this moral abyss.",
        "Sean: You know, I always read Nietzsche as saying there's gonna be a vacuum in the wake of  this Enlightenment destruction of God. And something's gonna fill it. And what's gonna fill it is political religions, for lack of a better phrase, like nationalism, or communism or fascism, right? Like, that these -isms would become the new anchors of identity.And human beings are deeply religious by nature, and that doesn't mean we're conventionally religious. I think what he meant was that human beings have a thirst for absolutes. We want to be certain, we want a horizon and a story that secures it for us. We want capital T truth, and  whether it's God or political ideologies, we're gonna glom on to whatever provides us with this horizon of meaning.Whatever gives us this way to interpret events and and validate action and all that kind of thing. That is partly why he was anticipating that there's gonna be a new kind of ideological metaphysical conflict in the 20th century, and it is a direct result of this destruction.",
        "Sean: You used the term Übermensch, right? The Superman. I think this is another term that  people know, and they probably know it came from Nietzsche, but they may not know what he actually meant by that. What was the Übermensch for him?",
        "Sean: One of the most, I think, beautiful accounts of Christ actually is in Nietzsche's book, The  Antichrist. He has this kind of begrudging respect for Christ. ",
        "Sean: As this figure who established this kind of new moral universe, right? That is a supreme  act of creation, and that is something he admires as much as anything.",
        "Sean: He says that there was,but one Christian and he died on the cross. ",
        "Sean: I wanna go back to something you, you mentioned earlier, and that is really his, his  hatred for democracy and his contempt for egalitarianism. ",
        "Sean: In your essay, in that anthology on Nietzsche, you say that we, we really ought to  understand him as – and now I'm quoting you – the most profound and dark defender of hierarchical reaction in the modern era.What makes him both profound and dark from your point of view?",
        "Sean: Yeah, I mean, this is something you see really throughout Nietzsche's writing: this deep  fear of the leveling power of mass culture. And he's always trying to protect the free creative individual against, to use his language, which you just used as well, the herd, and we shouldn't dance around this part of it, right? ",
        "Sean: He pretty clearly thinks that the average person cannot face up to reality, isn't up for the  challenge of creating themselves, right, in the wake of God's death.And the average person for that reason prefers to make a virtue of ignorance and self-fulfillment, and that's all he sees when he looks at democracy, this triumph of the least creative.",
        "Sean: Look, human beings are not all the exact same– there are differences between  individuals… anyone can observe that. It is the epitome of non-controversial. Some people are stronger, faster, smarter, better-looking… But… plenty of thinkers have made that same banal observation and still supported egalitarianism and liberal democracy. So, despite our differences, maybe all humans are equal on some deep metaphysical level. Or moral level, or whatever you prefer. Does Nietzsche actually give an argument for why he doesn’t think that’s true?",
        "Sean: I agree. ",
        "Sean: We tend to think of the political right as being mostly about this devotion to tradition or to  gradual change, but you say, no, it's really much more about a defense of hierarchical organization. Why is that an important distinction for you to make, especially today?",
        "Sean: Sure. The founder of the National Review, a very famous American conservative writer,  thinker, pundit.",
        "Sean: This is a really huge point. Most of the conservatives drawn to Nietzsche over the years  don't really wanna face up to his challenge, right? They may hate progressivism and they want to reinforce Christianity as a moral and civilizational anchor. But Nietzsche's whole point is that it doesn't work like that, right? If you're a conservative who hates progressivism, you have to realize that the progressive movement for more egalitarianism grew out of Christian soil. It is a secular extension of Christian morality. Nietzsche is at least consistent in his contempt for that, but a lot of conservatives aren't. So they're trying to have their cake and eat it too.",
        "Sean: It does feel like you… you sort of make a plea to the left. The left, certainly in this country,  has a kind of reflexive discomfort with religion, certainly in the American tradition. But part of what you're saying here, and certainly part of what Nietzsche would say is that no, actually contemporary progressivism is very much an heir to the Christian tradition and that that presents a kind of political opportunity for the left that they probably haven't made good use of up to this point, but maybe they should. ",
        "Sean: What do you make of Nietzsche’s appeal on what we now call the alt-right. I wrote a  piece about this for Vox a few years ago after I heard that racist halfwit Richard Spencer tell someone in an interview that he was, quote, red-pilled by Nietzsche. But this faction of reactionary politics today, or right wing politics today, it's younger and more transgressive and it's kind of weird and, and clearly Nietzsche is a popular figure for them. And I think part of what I see happening here is Nietzsche is a very subversive writer and thinker. And in the last decade or so, the left has achieved a kind of cultural supremacy, right? The left is sort of influencing the culture more than the right has been.And that has shifted some of that subversive transgressive energy to the alt-right, or whatever. And now there's this kind of punk rock delight in shit-posting anti-woke memes, and there's just something really juvenile about it. But I could see how Nietzsche could inspire it, right? He tells you, yeah, look, the society is all upside down.All these sacred cows need to be slaughtered. If you're living in a multi-ethnic society, you trash pluralism, right? If you're part of a liberal democracy, then you play with fascism, right? It's just negation for the sake of negation or just poking holes in sacred cows for the sake of poking holes in sacred cows, and really nothing besides.",
        "Sean: Paul Watson, is that, is that the Alex Jones guy? ",
        "Sean: Okay. PAUL: In fact, I’ve never seen so many members of the lefty twitterati as when I tweeted, “Conservatism is the new counterculture.” So I tweeted it again, and again, and again, and again.",
        "Sean: What do you think is the primary way in which the alt-right misappropriates or abuses or  misreads Nietzsche?",
        "Sean: Yep. ",
        "Sean: Well, that's sort of the other side of this. You know, if you're someone stewing in  resentment and you're searching for a psychologically satisfying explanation for your own discontent, this punk rock side of Nietzsche is pretty intoxicating. You read 'em and you're thinking to yourself, well, the problem isn't me. Right? It's, it's this unthinking herd out there, right? The world is rejecting me because I refuse to dance to the same conformist music as everyone as everyone else, right? When of course, the reality almost invariably is that the person thinking that is not the Übermensch he thinks he is. And yes, it's usually men. But if you're the type who doesn't like what the world's become or becoming, it is not hard to see the appeal of Nietzsche's obsession with decline and decadence. And, like, the Ayn Rand fanatics who, who read her work and think they're John Galt. Right? And society is stifling their greatness.You're not, I'm sorry to say, actually,",
        "Sean: Of course! ",
        "Sean: I mean, you're a teacher, I assume you, you teach Nietzsche. And, and I'm not asking  you, you, like, you, how do you counsel your students not to read Nietzsche? I mean, I think you and I both pretty firmly believe he is absolutely worth reading. Whatever you think of him.",
        "Sean: He's indispensable to trying to make sense of the pathologies of, of modern politics and  much, much more.But when you do encounter someone who's younger, like we once were, but when you do encounter someone who's being entranced by Nietzsche in some of these ways we've described, what do you say to them? How do you tell them to read Nietzsche or to take Nietzsche – or do you at all?",
        "Sean: What I've always said about Nietzsche is that, and I used to teach him as well, he can  only take you so far. And if you're concerned with politics, he will lead you into an abyss because he can't offer, doesn't wanna offer, any basis for meaningful collective action.  His thought necessarily collapses into a muddled individualism, which is why he, I think, ultimately becomes much more useful to artists than to politicians and legislators. But he remains incredibly important and incredibly dangerous because he was right about quite a bit, and we are still very much living in the shadow of his destruction."

        "I feel like this line between politics and culture has really become so gray, you  know, that everything is politics now that it becomes a psychological issue for us, where we can't really separate anymore what is our day-to-day life from the politics around us. Because I want to tell stories for everyone. I live in the middle of the country. I grew up in New York City. I've worked in Los Angeles, I've lived in San Francisco. I think there's value to living in the middle of the country, but you know, it gets harder and harder to reach everyone.You kind of have to choose your platform, and those platforms have become self-sorting in a way.

        "Noah: You know, to tell a story that tries to look at the world that we live in right now. Right?  How do you write about the world that we live in, especially in these last four years in a way that's going to even be relevant in that moment. But I did feel it was important to put myself in the book for the first time as sort of narrator, because I'm trying to think about the issues we're wrestling with in this world. And I think it's important to be a character in my own story, to address that. To say, look, I'm worried; you are worried. Let me try to create a fictional story of our world to see if I got it right. And so the challenge of finding a model for that brought me to Vonnegut and to Slaughterhouse-Five. You know, his story of his World War II experience, fictionalized, in which it's a story about a man who has come unstuck in time. It's a cross-genre book. It should not work. When you look at all the elements of it on paper, it should not work, but it does very much.",
        "Noah: Right, but I made a very deliberate choice never to use the word Democrat or  Republican, to try to simply describe things the way that I saw them without the names for them. So there's a lot of descriptions of one political party versus another political party. It's the swimmers versus the surfers, or it's the restaurant versus the bar, you know, in which the restaurant is the party where…Come in everyone and we'll feed you and there's a seat for everyone. But at the same time, we also feel like you should be paying the bills for the people who can't afford to eat there, versus the bar, which is now a sports bar, which is, you're on our team, or you're not on our team.

        "Noah: Well, I think there's a really interesting challenge that we're facing right now, which is:  how do you prepare your children to live in a world in which reality itself is up for debate? It's not something you and I had to learn when we went out into the world or our parents' generation or any other American generation before, really.But we are at this moment where, which reality you believe in depends very much on which political party you're associated with. And so, how do I raise a son or a daughter and send them out into the world? How do they navigate that problem of what's real and what's not real? And so I wanted in the story to take these late teens, early teens, to send them out into this world, having left an anxiety center, a kind of private psych hospital for teenagers, to go out and try to go on a quest, really, because the structure of the book became very rooted in the fantasy novel. It was an adventure novel, and that allowed me to say that the fantasy world that they're exploring is ours. It's either a, a fantasy novel about the real world we live in, or a real novel about the fantasy world we live in.",
        "Noah: I think that climate change has really escalated this, you know, climate change combined  with the fact that everyone in charge of our government is over 70. I have this feeling like, every Fortune 500 board of directors should have at least one 12 year old on it right now. We need to be moving toward this handoff to the next generation a lot faster than we normally do because that's who's going to be living with the problems that we've made.",
        "Noah: It is strange, I think that there is on some level a sense of reality shock that occurred in  2016 that we have not really recovered from. If you think back to the Pizzagate moment where this man went into a pizza restaurant in DC, and shot it up, he's looking for the dungeon where the Democrats are keeping the children.And there is no dungeon. And he's arrested. And what is that moment for somebody to realize that you've literally put yourself into prison chasing a reality that doesn't exist, that's a fantasy? And to make it stranger, right, what happens immediately the next day is that Alex Jones gets on the radio and says that this man is a false flag actor.He's part of the fantasy, right? So, if you're that guy in prison, suddenly you're part of the fantasy, not part of the reality anymore. These are very strange moments and you know, I explored it a bit in the third year of Fargo, this idea that there's violence to realizing that the world you're living in isn't what you thought it was.There's this mental trauma that people suffer from. And I think we're still trying to find our way back to where we were before, but I don't think there is a before anymore. We just have to figure out what's on the other side of it.",
        "Noah: Well, I think what's interesting is we have to figure out how to talk to each other, how to  tell stories that resonate with people despite the opinions they hold. We're ending up in a world where the only stories that really resonate with people are the unchallenging stories. There's a reason that Avatar is successful, or, or Marvel movies are successful.Those old brands can bypass this current quagmire that we're in. But I do feel like, and I wrote about this in The Atlantic, we are sort of hostage now to these American myths in our entertainment without even really realizing it. The myth of the reluctant hero or you know, the myth of frontier justice. All of these ideas that have come back in terms of the way that both sides are really seeing the world. All the energy that Democrats are spending, trying to understand the Republican mindset, and the conspiratorial mindset, et cetera, is not being reciprocated on the other side. You are not seeing a lot of analysis on Fox News or in conservative publications about why Democrats believe what they believe.What is the underlying basis. They're not doing socioeconomic studies to try to understand the mindset of economically challenged white voters, et cetera. Right? It's a very uneven balance. One side is really trying to understand where the other side is coming from, and then the other side is just projecting onto the first side.So, it is very strange because we obviously, we wanna understand. My job as a fiction writer and a creator of characters — all I'm doing is trying to recreate the world I live in to see if I can understand it. And so it does become fascinating to see that there are people who are burning thousands of hours of their lives trying to understand where people who don't agree with them are coming from.And then a whole other segment of the population that could on some level care less.",
        "Noah: Well, I think it's very important to understand that we're not talking about villains here.  We're talking about people, and that people find their way to beliefs and a way of looking at life in the same way. They just don't always end up in the same place. If you think about the movie Fargo, Bill Macy, Jerry Lundegaard… This whole thing could have been avoided if he had just said, I fucked up.And I had my wife kidnapped, and I made a huge mistake. But he can't admit the truth out loud, and in fact he can't even admit it to himself. And so much of Fargo is about the state of denial that characters are in, in which they can't admit what they've done or what is happening, and so much death and destruction comes out of that inability to communicate.And so that's the tragedy of it, right? Tragedy being a bad ending that was avoidable if different choices had been made.",
        "Noah: Right.  I see it differently. I see. I see the path to not tragedy is very clear and you just  choose to go in the tragic direction.music Why does Noah Hawley think that it’s high noon in America? That’s what I’ll ask him, after a quick break.MIDROLL 1",
        "Noah: Well, this idea of high noon is a myth ",
        "Noah: that the way the world actually works is… rarely is it white hat versus black hat in the  town square at noon. The reality of life, as in Fargo, is that it's a lot of elements on a collision course and you never know which ones are gonna collide and when. But we are searching always for high noon because we've been trained to feel like that's the most satisfying resolution, right? Not just that the guy with the white hat is gonna face the guy with the black hat, but that one of them is gonna kill the other one. That is the most satisfying version of a story for a lot of people.",
        "Noah: I think it allows our heroes to be good people, even though they might end up doing  something that is immoral at the end of the day. I talked very much when I sold the idea of making Fargo that it was about the people that we yearn to be, decent and kind, versus the people we fear the most. ",
        "Noah: But that it's like, you know, the myth of World War II where all these peaceful men put  down their plowshares and picked up rifles to go to fight Hitler. And then when they came back, you know, they melted their rifles and they picked up their plowshares and all they wanted was to go back to being peaceful men. Right? I think there's a very romantic sense of that. I think it gets confusing this idea — and we flirted with it in the late nineties and the early 2000s, all the anti-heroes that flooded our TV screens and our films, you know, the reluctant demon hunters who were out there, and they couldn't be happy, they had to be tortured so that we could sleep at night.And you know, I think there was something very meaningful about that, transformatively in our culture, that really played into a romantic sense that you feel on the right, which is like, this is the world. The world is the zombie apocalypse. The world is this ugly place where your neighbor would just as likely kill you as help you.So we have to be armed, we have to be ready. ",
        "Noah: And do you ever wonder why they put Donald Trump's head on Rambo's body? Like,  why Rambo? Except that he was just this Vietnam vet who had come back and he just wanted to settle back in and live a life. But the cops hassled him and they wouldn't leave him alone.And so he ended up having to destroy the system that was persecuting him.",
        "Noah: Yeah, I mean that — what I noticed about zombie movies is that the real enemy is  always other people. The zombies are just a backdrop against which society breaks down. And when you watch The Walking Dead, you have your core of heroes, right? And some of them are traitors and will ultimately betray you.But then it's always about running into that other group of people and those other group of people have either decided that they have to control you or destroy you or use you as bait, et cetera, et cetera. The zombie apocalypse films are rarely a kumbaya story of humanity coming together to fight this larger evil, right?And Game of Thrones flirted with this idea, right? That everything was politics and, you know, everyone was competing for the throne and it was a zero sum game. But then in the end, when they saw the zombies, they were like, Okay, we can put aside our differences and go and face this threat. And, where these two shows were popular in America, I think the New York Times map mapped it out and, and it, it lines up with very different segments of our population.The Walking Dead is, has been historically been very popular in the South and in more rural areas, and Game of Thrones is a more coastal elitist show for people to watch. And some of that of course is that HBO costs money, and AMC didn't cost money. But I think some of it is also… it's just a worldview.",
        "Noah: Well, and I think that, I think that, that, that's true for most people. Most people are not in  this camp of believing that your fellow man will turn on you at the drop of a dime. I think what gets troublesome is when the attraction of that myth gets tied up with a political worldview and, and tied to a larger political party that has a lot of moderation built into it.I mean, this idea of being a conservative was usually based on an idea of moderation. But now as the party is taken over by more radical elements, this worldview begins to seep into the more conservative, the more moderate elements until this dog eat dog worldview becomes, on some level, the only platform of the party.",
        "Noah: Well, you know, they're not polar opposite shows. If you remember, Game of Thrones  had a real gender violence problem, and it was on many levels a very male fantasy of how power works in the world. So on some levels, the two shows kind of overlap in certain areas.But, it's just in the way they resolved, right? Which was in a Game of Thrones they decided that, stronger together. They adopted a kind of liberal myth of a rising tide lifts all boats. I think on some level, these myths have always been more loaded than just entertainment.But I think they used to be more entertainment than staking a position. You know, the popularity of Yellowstone right now as a kind of team jersey, of who's watching it and who's not watching it, and what it means to people, in terms of Yellowstone, the idea that this man, this rancher who owns hundreds of thousands of acres is the best steward of the land. That the native tribe wants the land back, but even they have to admit that John Dutton is the best steward of this land.And in the show, this Dutton family will literally kill anyone who challenges their ownership of the land. And that's a heroic quality as presented on the show. You know, and it's a very different way of looking at the world than a lot of other shows present.ways float above it? You know, I always thought — it always felt like a very dark, very existentialist show that is actually full of commentary if you're listening, but it never seemed to be celebrating anything in the way that some of these other shows — or glorifying some of these things in the way these other shows we’re talking about do.Noah: Well, I mean, the lessons that I took fro the movie Fargo and from Joel and Ethan's work  is that violence should never be entertainment. When you think about the violence in the movie Fargo, it's always really shocking. It happens quickly. It's very graphic. The state trooper gets shot in the head and the amount of blood that comes out leaves the viewer like Steve Buscemi going, “Whoa, daddy.” So what's interesting to me always is, we're so trained to want High Noon. We're so trained to feel like violence is story and action and resolves things.And, and I always like to walk viewers up to a line, and then there's a certain moment in which you go, Oh, I don't like this. I wanted this, but now it's here and I don't want it. You know what I mean? And for me, there's never a really a white hat versus black hat moment on the show.",
        "Noah: Well for me, the show was always the story of decency versus evil. Not good versus evil,  but decency, basic decency. The idea that, when left to their own devices, most Americans, they just want their family to be okay. They just want to do the right thing. And sometimes forces will rise up that are a true threat and have to be dealt with. But one never takes joy in it. And it's never easy. And the hope, like at the end of the film, when Marge has seen the most, the worst case she'll ever see, and she's got two months till the baby's born and her husband got the 3 cent stamp, and tomorrow is gonna be just another day.And that's her reward. We want to go back to safety and security, and the challenge that I'm exploring in this next season, right, is this idea of “Minnesota nice.” Which is the sort of comic underpinnings of Fargo, Which is a, is polite society, places in which people are so… in the sort of Lutheran way, they don't wanna offend anyone.They won't say something out loud that might offend anyone. And you end up with a very passive aggressive civilization. But then, you look at the school board meetings right now, right? And there's nothing passive about it, right? So, once the Minnesota nice goes away, what's left in Minnesota?And yet at the end of the day, people just care about their kids, right? And whether they've come to believe that vaccines are evil or, teaching kids about racism is harming their children… at the end of the day, it's not that they're evil people, they just care about their kids and this is the way they think they can protect their kids.",
        "Noah: Well, you know, I make a point in the book to say that the book is not satire. Satire used  to be a very effective way to police bad behavior in our society because you would mock someone who is doing wrong and they would feel shame. But we live in this inverted reality moment in which the things that people used to feel ashamed about, they're now very proud of. And so we've reached this moment of absurdity in terms of members of Congress, for example, who are under investigation for trafficking minors across And it used to be that you could shame people like that, but they don't feel shame anymore. I started thinking in the third year of Fargo about this idea that irony without humor is just violence. If you think about, if you think about Kafka, right? A man is put on trial for a crime that he will never know what they're accusing him of.And it's absurd, but it's not funny. And so what it is is just violent. It does violence to your mind to try to resolve that. We've hit that moment in which, you know, there's always a moment in Fargo where the worst person in the show says, I'm the victim here. And then that has now become our reality where you hear a lot of men claiming to be victims in our society who have been victimized in no way, who still have all the power and the ability to dictate the conversation. And yet they could not be screaming louder about their own victimization.",
        "Noah: Well, you know, someone once said, it's hard to be useful and sad. Like, that act of  helping others, when you look at a society and and what actually makes people feel good about themselves, it's not helping themselves, it's helping other people.But I think we're always struggling with what our young people can be doing. You know, in different regions of the world, the less that young men specifically have to occupy themselves, the more trouble they get into.",
        "Noah: And, I went to the dermatologist the other day and, you know, I told him that I'd started  taking testosterone cause my testosterone was low. And he was like, oh, do you listen to Joe Rogan? Because apparently Joe is just telling every man in his twenties to take testosterone.Which is not what young men need — more testosterone. ",
        "Noah: But the problem is that if you don't have enough to do with yourself and a sense of  purpose, then you get into trouble because this is the age, you know, people in their twenties, this is when you're most passionate.Right? That's why we had the Civil Rights movement, and the sixties, the youth culture revolt, et cetera, you know, and then in the late nineties we had the dot-com revolution. You know, it was something for young people to get really passionate about. And, there's just been this really fascinating inversion of passion and co-option of language, of what used to be the left by the right in terms of my body, my choice, which is now about vaccines, and, you know, in Russia they had free and fair elections and a free and fair election in the Soviet Union was you show up, they hand you a ballot that's already been filled out, and you put it in the box and you have voted. And they called that a free and fair election.And part of why they called it that is so that when you tried to have a revolution and change it, what were you gonna call it? The name had already been co-opted, the words we had to say free and fair meant the exact opposite. So what words could you use? You know? And so that's where we get back to this: irony without humor is just violence, right? It boggles the mind. It, it shuts the mind down on some level, which I think is the point.",
        "Noah: Right. ",
        "Noah: You know, I remember talking to, to Chris McQuarrie, who is making the Mission  Impossible movies where Paramount, which is the studio was saying, we need to get more young men watching these movies. And Chris was like, well, young men want John Wick.That's what young men want. So, if that's the audience you want to get, then you have to really increase the graphicness of the violence and the intensity of the violence in these movies. And of course that's not true for all young men. I was a young man once. You were a young man once. I wasn't John Wick crazy.But it is worth thinking about the fact that there is this testosterone of youth that wants confrontation, that wants violence, and sometimes it's, you know, the joy of intellectual combat as well, but there is an attraction to white hat versus black hat in the town square, that, as you get older and you realize that life is more complicated than that, maybe you're more open to stories that resolve less concretely. But, if you're not occupied enough and you're looking for stories that give you big feelings, which is what you want as a young person, those are the stories that are working.",
        "Noah: Well, you know, I, I came of age in the seventies, in the height of second wave feminism,  and my mother was a feminist writer in New York City in the seventies. And I was very aware when I reached sexual maturity that I had come of age both as a sexual person and as a potential sexual predator.Right? Like that this was… this was one version of what a man is, right, is that there's always the potential for violence that women feel from men. And so as a man with a feminist mother, I had to be able to hold those two ideas at the same time, which was, I have to be careful with the power that I have and not abuse it.And I think the complexity of that is something that, if you face it, makes you a richer person. But what we're seeing now is a large rejection of any culpability or potential culpability, or even the idea of culpability, right? The idea that someone who is male is privileging from the very fact of their gender. And if you're not able to even entertain the notion of blame on yourself, then what you end up with is you have to fight harder and harder. I think we all thought when the internet was born that it would be a place in which everyone would feel comfortable saying their truths out loud. But what we realized was that there are a lot of people whose truths are very uncomfortable for the people who are used to being heard in our society. And so you had a lot of people who suddenly were like, well, I don't want to hear that.That makes me feel bad about myself. And we have to be able to feel bad about ourselves. It's okay. Like, I'm a grownup. I can have that feeling. As Molly Ivins said once, it's like, I can disagree with people and not hate them because I'm an adult.music We’ve got to take one last quick break, but when we come back, I’ll ask Noah about the new vision of justice that he’s said will be featured on the upcoming fifth season of Fargo.MIDROLL 2",
        "Noah: Yeah, I mean, I think it's important to try to tell stories right now that champion the  system of justice, the idea of justice as a group effort, in which we come together as society and we make laws and we enforce these laws, and not this reluctant hero version, which I have done myself.Knowingly or unknowingly, in three of the four seasons so far, I have had a police officer character who is at odds with his or her boss, where the system of justice is either corrupt or incompetent. And this reluctant hero is going to solve the case no matter what gets in their way, right? And it's a very romantic notion, and I think we appreciate the simplicity of it. There's a hero and they're gonna do the right thing. But, that's not really how our system works. Our justice system works like, a case is brought, and it's a cooperation between many facets of our law enforcement, and prosecutors and judges and et cetera.And it doesn't work very well much of the time. But when it does work well, it is the best form of justice there is because it is not emotional. And I think to tell a story in which the system of justice wins in the end, in this moment in which our system of justice is under such attack in which there's literally now a Congressional committee on the weaponization of the government, by which they mean investigating people who are believed to have committed crimes.Again, you know, “free and fair elections” and the corruption of language. I mean, for all of our conversations about our current attorney general and why doesn't he move faster, et cetera, and why is he so deliberate and is it a good thing or a bad thing? He believes in the system of justice and he's trying to make it work so that no one can complain, which of course is impossible because, people gonna complain.But at the end of the day, if the system of justice checks every box and justice is done, then the outcome is defendable and history will reflect that.",
        "Noah: I don't know that, that it's that your two options are cynicism or hopefulness. I mean, I, I  think all I'm trying to do is, kind of hold the society that I was raised in to its principles.And do I hope that in real life it will do that? Well, I'm telling a fictionalized story, so, I would hope that in real life, it would do it. In a fictionalized story, I can do it, but I also can't make it white hat, black hat. It has to be complicated because, it is always complicated and it's still a tragedy, right? Even when it happens, it's still a tragedy, because a crime was committed.",
        "Noah: Yes. Well, what's interesting in this idea of frontier justice, which is another name for is vigilante justice that we've kind of — are getting back to, and that's what on some level January 6th was about, which is the sense that that, nobody can really tell us that what's right and what's wrong. We all know in our heart what is right and what is wrong. It's the emphasis on right and wrong versus legal and illegal. And if you believe that, you know, your morals, your beliefs are that the world is an inherently violent place, that you need weapons in order to protect yourself in this place, that the people who are telling you to disarm are fundamentally delusional about the way the world actually is, then at a certain point, this belief in frontier justice is a self-fulfilling prophecy, right? Because you are on a collision course with the law. And so, if the choice is either to be a criminal in this reality or to bring about frontier justice so that you are not a criminal, then the choice seems to be clear. it’s like, I don't want to be a criminal in this world in which the sheep are telling me that there is no wolf. Then you might begin to believe that the sheep is actually the wolf. And you have to defend yourself. And, you know, I say in the piece, it's like you have 40% of the country that believes the zombie apocalypse is already here, but the people they’re aiming their guns out are the other 60% of society who are just trying to understand like, well, what are you talking about?Like, we're all just here. We could all figure this out the way we have for the last couple hundred years of, like, not everyone's happy all the time, but we figure out what the middle ground is and apparently there's no middle ground left.",
        "Noah: What's fascinating to me is like all of the conversations I have with the legal department  at MGM or at FX about what I can say and not say, and show and not show and, products licensed or not licensed, no one has ever said to me, “You cannot say this is a true story ‘cause it's not a true story.”Like they've never said that to me. And on some level, I guess it's ‘cause the movie said that. But it is crazy that we announce to the world that this made up story is true and no one argues, no one's trying to say that it's not.",
        "Noah: Yeah.  ",
        "Noah: What I learned early on is that audiences react emotionally and instinctually to stories.  And, there's some very clear things that audiences want. They want relationships to work out. They want families to stay together. They want the good guy to win in the end.We love the idea of redemption. So, none of those things have changed for us. I think what's interesting is this idea of what happened to Jesus. Right. Jesus used to be, turn the other cheek, do unto others as you would have them do unto you.And now for a large part of our society, Jesus is Warrior Jesus. Jesus is kick-ass-and-take-names Jesus. Jesus isn't forgiving anybody. And, what's fascinating about that is what one has to do to continue to say that you believe in Jesus and what Jesus stood for, you have to change what Jesus stood for in order to do what you want to do, if it's not turn the other cheek and forgive. It's sort of been a fascinating to watch as a storyteller, this sense that there's a lot of people out there yelling about the threats to Christianity, but it feels like the definition has changed of what's being defended. And you know, I believe as a storyteller that we live on a religious planet. By far, the majority of people on this earth believe in God in one form or another. And so if you're telling a story that doesn't have religion in it, you're not talking about people, but I do feel a little bit caught out that, that what they're praying for at the dinner table is still all the old, do unto other which sort of feels like, you know, outta step with the current moment.",
        "Noah: Right. ",
        "Noah: Well, it's, you know, if, if everything is in flux, then everything is in flux, right? What are  we steering by? What are we grounding ourselves with? I mean, I set out in writing Anthem, I ended up writing a book about this moment in America because the question of like, well, wait a minute, what is that? became so loud, that it threatened to dwarf the story. ",
        "It's really funny cuz like you can obviously come up with a bunch of stories  for why you are where you are. But in this particular case, it actually is quite a direct story. Like I was in, I was studying economics in undergrad and I was in a labor market economics class and there was like an extra assigned reading for something and it was a paper by a Yale law professor called David Schleicher.And it was a paper called \"Stuck\". And this was in 2017 and so it was right after Donald Trump had just won the presidential election, and was about to be sworn in, I believe. And so everyone was like, there were all these theories floating about, around, what's going on in real America, like what has happened to upend conventional political thinking around who was going to win this election. Basically the premise of the paper was that for a long period of time, moving from an economically depressed region to one that was growing would always pay off from an economic standpoint because even though the cost of living was higher, the wages you were earning were so much higher than what you would've been earning, that it made sense to move.So if you're a janitor in New York City, you're making a lot more and your standard of living is a lot higher than if you are a low wage worker in a rural town. That doesn't have the same kind of economic opportunities. But over the course of the late 20th century, as we're seeing a lot of things in particular, as we're seeing the cost of housing grow, this script begins to flip that like, yes, you see a lot higher wages, but for more and more people, the cost of living grows to the point that you don't actually see this pencil out. And so what that means is that a lot of people end up being stuck in these communities where there aren't really good jobs, but the good jobs are in a place where the cost of living is too high for them to access it. And, you know, I was like, you know, a senior in college and I was like, wow. Like I have figured out exactly why, all of these people voted for Donald Trump. And I had this like a monocausal explanation for a couple of months. But the more I got into housing, the more I realized that there's just really under. Or, or misunderstood and also, um, largely ignored phenomenon of, of what's going on in our housing market.And it's really, really important and it plays a really big role in how people's lives turn out. ",
        "Jerusalem: The fundamental problem is that housing policy is not oriented around making sure  that there is affordable, accessible housing for everyone. And there's a bunch of things that stream out. Because we are not focused on that, we're focused on a bunch of things, whether it's preserving the way communities look right now, or increasing property values in some areas, or whatever it is, because our focus is not affordable accessible housing, you have a bunch of different policies that spring from that, that end up making it impossible for people to live where they need to live. And I think it can sound really wonky when we're talking about things like zoning regulations or housing finance, or how to finance affordable housing or whatever it is.But at the fundamental level, it's just like, people should be free to live where they want to live because that's like the foundation for a good life. Picking your own community or being able to stay in a community that you're rooted in. It is the foundation for your spiritual life or your, like, personal life or the people you end up wanting to be friends with or marry or whatever it is.And if you're not able to make the choice about where you live under a housing market that is basically excluding you because of prices, because of rents, because of fundamentally insufficient supply and insufficient diversity of types of housing, then you can't make that choice.You're being pushed to live where you can afford to live, and that means your community is being chosen for you. It means your life is being chosen for you in a way that you have very little control over.",
        "Jerusalem: Yeah,it's a big question because I mean, it depends, it's like affordable for who, like  what do we mean by this? And, the federal government has this idea of what's affordable to someone with a certain percentage of the area median income.So like someone with 50% of the area median income. So who's doing worse than a lot of people in their community, what's affordable to them is obviously very different than the 75th percentile or 150% or whatever it is.  But then also there's this question of like, how much of this is bringing down the cost and how much of this is a problem of poverty. Like, often people are talking about affordable housing, they're talking about it from a middle class standpoint. Like, they're talking about how can I afford a first starter home that's 300 or $400,000? Um, and for a lot of people who are working in the housing space, when they're talking about affordable housing, they're really focused on low income renters, people who could maybe afford, you know, 300, $400 a month to pay on rent.And so, I agree that this is like a very nebulous term, but I also think it's just like this, the animating idea that like regular people should be able to afford housing and shelter is like not really what's at the center of what we're doing today,",
        "Jerusalem: I think in general with these conversations, because as I've mentioned, housing is  so personal to people. I wanna make sure, like I am often just trying to talk about housing policy at a macro level. I think the individual decisions people are making for their lives or like == you're, we're all constrained by what's available to us. And also there's a lot of good reasons to be a homeowner. So no shame. No shame.",
        "Jerusalem: Yeah, this is a really good question, and I think it requires taking a step back to  think about what we mean by causality. Like what causes what. Because if you talk to someone you know on the street or someone who's at a shelter or someone who is couch surfing, and you say like, Hey, like how did you end up in the situation? They're gonna tell you a story about individual vulnerability that is completely true. They're gonna tell you about maybe a divorce that they went through that cut their income in half. They're gonna talk about a medical emergency that they went through that really impacted their finances, a lost job, a predatory landlord that evicted them and left them with a black mark on their record that made it difficult for them to rent again.And all of these things are true, for that person. Like that's what happened. But when we think about macro changes across time, you have to look for what's changing, at the societal level because there have always been predatory landlords. There's always been poverty, there's been lots of divorce. There's been all these different things. But the rate at which we're seeing folks become homeless, now it's around 500,000 people in this country are homeless. And more importantly, there are tens of millions of low income renters who are always at that brink of potentially becoming homeless if they face one of these emergencies. That is new.And the cause of that is when you look across the country, there are states that are high poverty that don't see the kinds of homelessness that places like California and Washington and Massachusetts see. When you look at places that have high rates of mental illness and high rates of drug addiction, they don't see the level of homelessness.What you do see across the country is that what determines whether a state sees or an area sees high rates of homelessness is whether it a sufficient amount of housing available to very low income renters. And whether the very bottom of the market, there are renting opportunities available for people who are in dire financial situations.And if those exist, like in places like Detroit or in Philadelphia where there's a lot of housing relative to what we see in places like San Francisco or LA or Boston or DC, you don't see that rates of homelessness, even if there's poverty, even if there's mental health issues, even if there's drug addiction – because the housing is available.And it sounds really simplistic, but like the problem of homelessness is in the name. It's homes. People don't have them. And I think it's really reasonable why people don't conceptualize it this way. If you come across homelessness in your daily life, you're likely to experience it or remember it in a way that's pretty jarring. Like maybe you see someone experiencing a mental health crisis, or you see like drug addiction going on, or you see something that seems extremely jarring to you in public. And that becomes your vision for how homelessness functions in society. But most homelessness is like not seen that way, right? You don't notice someone who's crashing at a motel. You don't notice someone who's couch surfing in their friend's apartment, kids being separated to different family homes because there's no central place where they can all live together. Those things are really hidden and that's what makes up the bulk of homelessness.",
        "Jerusalem: Yeah, and I think it’s sort of like a funnel, right? Like you have at the very top, a  large number of people who are in unstable housing situations who are low income, for whom a specific emergency might push them into homelessness. And then of those people, like a certain number, if there's not enough housing, will fall into homelessness. And then for many of those people, it'll become much more worse, whether because of individual vulnerability, like the ones we talked about. Or because of just bad luck. I mean, luck is also a big factor in this. When you talk to people who are homeless, you're just like, wow. Like that's just like insanely unlucky, that that would happen to you on top of all these things.And for those people, when these populations are large enough, then you get a larger growing number of people who are chronically homeless, who are experiencing extremely difficult things on the street, and then become exposed to potentially really harmful drug situations or criminal activity and become victimized themselves and enter that kind of cycle of poverty and violence.And that's a situation where, I think it's really important to realize that people see this and they're saying like, okay, like I just don't get why the government can't get these people off the street. It's only 500,000 people, and that's actually a quite manageable sum for the entirety of the United States, right? Like, that's not actually that many people. When you think about all the government services that are available.The problem is, of course, we have to address the flow of people who are falling down that funnel. You have to stabilize those people so we can actually help the chronically homeless, the folks who are in shelters, to get outta that situation.",
        "Jerusalem: Yes. So the fundamental reason, and in particularly in these really high cost of  living cities and counties and suburbs, where the house, the homelessness crisis is most acute, is because it is illegal to build housing. And I wanna be clear here, what I mean is that in these places, you own a single family home that is on a lot where the city has said it must be minimum 10,000 square feet. And you are not allowed to tear that home down and build a house that is 9,000 square feet.You own this home and it is illegal for you to do this. And that is compounded by regulation after regulation. It's illegal for you to build a duplex on that lot. It is illegal for you to build a mother-in-law suite in your backyard on that lot. And what that does is that it compresses the number of housing opportunities that are available to people.And it also inflates the size artificially of the houses that are allowed to be built, which means that houses more and more are built to, over the course of the 20th century, we see houses being getting larger and larger. It used to be that you could find tons of starter homes, 1500 square feet, that would be like a first house that someone would buy, maybe when they're in their late twenties, early thirties.The supply of those starter homes is like dwindling to near non-existence, especially in these areas. What that means is that it becomes, you're raising the floor for what it means to buy a house. ",
        "Jerusalem: I think it's hard to tease out the story of zoning regulations is, alot of it has to do  with wanting to keep areas segregated by race and by class in particular. And even when that gets struck down, there is a desire to maintain a certain type of community, which includes kind of racialized and classist ideas. But also is just like, those ideas inform then what we think of as a nice neighborhood. This idea of like a white picket fence, every house kind of looks the same. That's also informed by how our transportation policy was created as well. And obviously there would be big houses in America regardless of this. It's a very wealthy country we live in and there are a lot of people who could afford to have bigger houses. But there are a lot of people who can't, who used to be able to buy their way in or rent their way to greater degrees of prosperity. And that being eliminated, I think has a lot less to do with culture and a lot more to do with the literal policies,and both unintended and intended effects of making it illegal to build even small single family homes.music It’s not just money…homeowners employ a ton of tactics to maintain their property values. Coming up after the break, Jerusalem and I discuss the sneaky but consequential world of environmental protections….MIDROLL 1music ",
        "Jerusalem: Yeah, so, in the US, one example of this is there's a law called the National  Environmental Policy Act. And it mostly applies to like big transit projects or just large, very, very large projects that might be done, energy projects or things like that. And then at the state and local level, there are environmental regulations that are modeled off of this. What ends up happening is that you create this framework for which developers or individual property owners have to justify to the state, that the thing that they're trying to build does not violate some sort of environmental desire. And that sounds good in practice, right? Like you think like, oh yeah, it makes sense. Like when someone's building something, we don't want it to harm the environment. But what's actually happening is that, things that are obviously not going to be harming the environment like a bike lane, like a solar project, like are being stopped in protection of things like parking lots, or, you know, single family homes, which we know increase car dependency and make it more difficult to transition to a more clean energy future. And so what ends up happening is that on project by project level, you are creating these regulations that are really, really onerous. We know that multifamily housing is more environmentally friendly. One, because heating costs and cooling costs are shared amongst a bunch of different people. Like I live in an apartment building, even if I turn my heat off, it doesn't get that cold in here because my neighbors have their heat on. The building itself is heated in the hallways and things like that. That shared environmental benefit is obviously baked in. But in other countries, right, we trust the government to say, the government itself will have the ability to make the determination about whether or not something is environmentally friendly or not. And instead in our country, what we do is we create this avenue for people to sue. And so you can sue and say, Hey, I don't think that this environmental impact statement or this report was filled out properly. And then you just, instead of actually pursuing the end of environmental protection, what you've done is create a space for people who have access to lawyers, very wealthy people, interest groups.",
        "Jerusalem: And it's one of those things where it's like very clear that these laws are being used  and a ton of regulations, which sound really good in theory, are actually being used for bad ends.",
        "Jerusalem: Yeah, I definitely think this is one of the things that's most important to recognize is  that people really are good in recent decades at identifying regulatory capture, right?But what we've become not very good at seeing is the way in which we ourselves or people who are regular voters can also capture parts of government and make it difficult to do things that are broadly popular or broadly necessary for the rest of us.So, for instance, you know, homeowners, there's nothing wrong with being a homeowner. Of course not. But we've created a system in which we've pitted certain people's interests against everyone's interests. And what that means is, like, some groups of homeowners may not want people living there who are very, very wealthy, may not want poor people in their community.I wrote a story last year about how this very, um, expensive exclusive town in Atherton, California. This guy named Mark Andreessen, he is a venture capitalist, he's a billionaire.. He has written a lot about how government is captured by incumbent interests, how we need to build big things. He and his wife submitted a public comment in his town of Atherton opposing the building of multifamily housing, saying that it would destroy property values, and raising a significant other concerns.And it's just that, it's a situation where, we have created a system where like someone like that can recognize, of course, on a societal level how harmful it is to stimi the government in this kind of opposition. And how much it makes it difficult to build things that are necessary, whether it's housing or infrastructure projects or renewable energy or whatever it is.But at the same time, on an individual level, feels empowered to stop that in their own community. And if there are people in every community who wanna stop that, they're not gonna feel individually responsible for the collective effect. But that system is making them individually responsible. And within liberalism, I think that you just mentioned, I think there are these competing impulses of like, feeling a sense of urgency around climate change, feeling a sense of urgency around racial justice and class justice and economic justice.And at the same time, feeling a sense that there should be community control, which prevents the government and prevents the private market from building things. And it's a balance. There's a level at which you want both of those things to exist, but we've shifted so far in the direction of community control at this point where, if there's a scarcity of something, rich people are gonna get it, you know,And so, it's people who are in the middle class, it's people who are poor, who are gonna be really screwed in that situation.",
        "Jerusalem: Yeah. ",
        "Jerusalem: I mean, I think with California, they're just a little bit ahead of the curve of what  what's coming down the pipe for a lot of places. So the places that are experiencing the worst of the housing crisis are the places that have seen the most economic growth. And that means a ton of people have tried to move there to share in that economic growth, to add to that economic growth, to take part in the dynamism that exists in these places.And California has not one, but two major centers of that, both Los Angeles and San Francisco. And it benefited from that for a long time. It benefited from that. That is the one of the growing parts of the entirety of the US economy, let alone the California economy, is this pull to have really great workers come in and economists refer its idea as agglomeration economies, when workers come together, when workers come together and firms come together and discover that they're more productive together than they are further apart. That's why you get a Silicon Valley. That's why you get like a Hollywood, people come together and they learn from each other. They spin off and create new things that are related to those fields. But on top of that, it's not just those people, right? When those people all move there, they demand a bunch of services and goods. They demand lawyers and legal services. They demand doctors and nurses and hospitals. They demand taxi drivers, new restaurants, all these different things. So you create a bunch of different jobs that aren't just directly related to that field. And while California enjoyed that growth, it didn't wanna accommodate for that growth by building sufficient housing.Now, other places are also growing, right? Like it's not just the California cities. And the other superstar cities with similar phenomenons like Seattle or Boston or DC or whatever it is. You now see cities growing like Austin, Texas, like Phoenix, Arizona, like Miami, like, Raleigh – all these different cities, Nashville. Like you see these cities also experiencing increasing amounts of growth, both because they have things that they're pulling industries to. But also because California, Seattle, all these other places haven't accommodated for workers, and workers are forced to move. And of course in the last couple of years, the new phenomenon of remote work has allowed for more and more people to forgo living in these places and still benefit from those jobs. And so you see a lot of growth happening. And you see a lot of the patterns being repeated, right? Like you see in Florida, Florida State government, which is a place that has, you know, traditionally really been telling people – Move here. We want that growth. We're excited for it –  trying to block local efforts to build more housing. So it's not a thing that I think is specific to California. I think that California was just, and the west coast in general were just, ahead of the curve in the economic experience.",
        "Jerusalem: Two things here.  One is that not in my backyard usually refers to someone who is in favor of something in general. Like, you're in favor of affordable housing in general. But you're not in favor of it in your backyard or like your neighborhood or something like that. So I think that that's really evident amongst liberals, because I think we, like, often do talk a lot about wanting more affordable housing or wanting more clean energy. But the idea of just in general, this idea of opposition towards new things, towards change, towards growth, I think it's just like a human thing. I think we're all kind of like NIMBYs in that way, right? If you buy a house in a community, you kind of like the way that it is. You could imagine certain things changing for the better. Like maybe you want more trees or you want, like, the curb to be repainted or whatever it is. So you have things that you can imagine improving it, but like they're small things usually, or like obvious improvements that are not really structural, big changes that are different than what you would've imagined when you first bought the house.And so I think that that's a pretty human element. And what you want in a society is a government which can mediate between desires for stability, and also accommodate and encourage healthy growth and change. Because I think that when people become too attached to a community as a series of buildings or infrastructure, they can forget the thing that makes their community great are the people, right?I think about this a lot, in like, I grew up right outside DC and you know, you can just trace the growth of where new immigrant food pops up based on the commercial rents in an area. And it used to be that, like, there were lots of cool, new, amazing restaurants popping up all around the inner core of DC all the time.And now, I mean, for the last decade at least, all of them have been in the suburbs and further and further out from the core. And so are you missing out on cool new, amazing things that new people can bring you? Because places only really change and experiment when they're available to people for whom changing and experimenting is what you wanna do.So you're young, you don't have a lot of money, you need to rent somewhere cheap. You can't have that, then you're not going to have that kind of dynamism.",
        "Jerusalem: Yeah, I think a few things here.  One is that it's not actually clear to me that people are actually working in service of their property values here. Let's take that example of like, you own your own property and a developer comes to you, Sean, and says the city has just upzoned and they now are allowing me to build a duplex on your lot. And now your lot is worth a lot more to me than it was before when it was just a single family home. And I say, Sean, I'll pay you $200,000 more – me the developer – than what you paid for it, to buy your house and turn that into a duplex.Your property values have gone up because it's become more possible to build more housing. So, it's not really clear to me that people are actually acting always in their financial interest when they do this. We've created this idea in America in general that like apartments are blights, that people who live in them are poor, they're immigrants, it's dirty, those are slums.This is something that's been developed and pushed both by, like, the court system and also politicians and cultural rhetoric. Which is not something that was inherently going to be that way. It was definitely something that was created intentionally. But, that first point I think is really important that, like, I don't think people are often acting in their best financial interests. Especially when you factor in, when you grow older, there's now tons of people. Like AARP is now an organization that's been working a lot on housing supply because they have a phenomenon of seniors who buy houses, they are trapped in them, because they're like, you know, the house is an asset that has like money stored in it, but they don't wanna move.But they also can't access a second floor of their house anymore because they can't go upstairs. And so they're stuck on the bottom floor of their home. So they're confined to the first floor of their homes, and they would move to a smaller unit in their community, but that doesn't exist, because they've been opposing the building and construction of affordable housing, or of different types of housing in their areas.And so you're screwing over your future self, often as a homeowner, when you oppose these things. You're screwing over your kids, maybe, who won't be able to stay and grow up and live in your community. That means you can't live near your grandkids.So I think that there's this idea that these people are always acting in their best interests and often they actually are not. So I think the important thing is here, how do you construct a government system which takes the reasonable concerns around massive amounts of change and weighs those against the costs of not building?Because if I turn to you and I said like – Hey, you can vote for this policy and you'll get to keep your neighborhood exactly how you like it, but it's gonna cost every worker in America $10,000 a year. We would think that's ridiculous. But that's actually what's going on here, is that the costs are so great that wages have been impacted at that kind of a level.And so, I, I really do think that it's a question, not of how do we change people's minds around this, but how do we create a government system which mediates all of these concerns in a reasonable way?",
        "Jerusalem: So, I mean, the first thing I'll say is I, I like to put people in kind of in the mindset of  what would happen to them and try to, like, logic this out a bit, right? Let's say that Sean, for some reason you had a massive financial emergency. You and your family are about to be homeless. The first thing that you probably do is you tap your family and friend connections. Like, hi, like, can you help me out for a little bit? Like, I just need to get back on my feet. People can't help you out. You like, make sure your kids are okay. You make sure your spouse is okay. You try to find a place to have just immediate shelter. The idea that someone would leave their community to go to a place that they have never been to where they have no connections to job networks, no connections to social supports, because they heard that San Francisco or Los Angeles is like a better place to be homeless doesn't actually make any sense, like, it's just not how individual people react to crises. They stay in their places they're familiar with because they know that they can get access to services or help from the networks that they already have in those places. So we know that people like, you know, maybe would move from like a Montgomery County, Maryland to a DC, or they'd move from like a Long Island to a Manhattan or something like that.But people are not making multi-state trips to get to blue cities to get access to services, which often are not actually that great, especially on the West Coast, which we know never has enough beds anymore to accommodate the homeless population. The second thing is though, when you look at randomized control trials of whether or not government supports, like, giving renters more income or whatever it is, reduces or increases homelessness. It reduces homelessness. So it's one of those things where, again, like it's technically true that we do not have sufficient data to fully disprove this theory, but all the data that we do have pushes against this idea. And also just common sense around how regular people would behave pushes against this idea. So I do think it's one of those things where people want to find something else to blame because the actual culprit is just really, really difficult to solve on a political level.music Is the American dream of owning a house…. a myth we should all let go of?MIDROLL 2music ",
        "Jerusalem: I think the real problem with that message is how uniformly positive it is about home  ownership for everyone at every stage at any point. What you have right now is a culture and a politics, which says to every single person, the second that you can buy a house, do so. And we reinforce that message by not caring, or trying to fix how bad the rental market is. If we actually thought that home ownership was a really meaningfully good choice, we wouldn't need to prop it up through all these financial gimmicks or whatever it is the federal government does to try to prop it up. We would not ignore how terrible the rental market is because honestly, a lot of people are choosing to own a house because the rental market is so bad that they're just trying to escape that reality. Whether it's not being able to have ownership over your space, like you can't paint the walls the way you want to, or you can't garden the way you want to, or you're at the behest of a landlord who might just pop in unannounced, or might just kick you out if he doesn't want you there anymore. And also at the lower end, really a threat of unfair, unreasonable and predatory eviction practices or whatever else is happening.And so I think that's one of those things where meaningful choice towards home ownership is not being had in this country because we've made the alternative so terrible for most people that it's really the only thing you can do if you wanna have a secure future. And so largely my point, and I have this article for The Atlantic, about the Home Ownership society and rethinking it, is that it's a really heterogeneous experience. For a lot of people, owning a house is a great financial decision that works out well for you. For the marginal person, for the person right now who's considering buying a house, I think it's a really mixed bag. A lot of the properties that are available to you might be extremely old, in need of repair, might sink tons and tons more money into it. Climate change is making it such that a lot of properties that are at the affordable level for people are things that are going to potentially be destroyed by storms or fires or whatever.I referenced a finding by NPR around how the department of housing and urban development, which was in a quintessential example of having like pro home ownership reign is attempting to push more and more people, especially, first time home buyers and people of color, into accessing home ownership, which sounds like a really great goal. And they end up pushing them to buy homes that are directly going to be flooded, with near certainty, in the next couple of years. And it's one of those things where it's, these homes have already flooded, this area has already flooded, and it will flood again. And it's one of those things where, do we actually think that the cult of home ownership is such an amazing thing to join, that we are saying to someone that it is better that you own a home that will likely experience this massive financial harm in the future. And also just like the personal harm and stress of having all your stuff flooded is obviously also terrible and is not really priced in. And so I think there are all these things like this that we don't consider when we tell people to buy houses that are really important.",
        "Jerusalem: But even there, Sean, I think that's what's so crazy. Even there, in those places,  like, would anyone three years ago have guessed that there would be a shock to labor markets that would allow people at high levels to move out of San Francisco and still work in tech? Like, remote work was not predicted by almost anyone at this level, like we have 20% of workers working at some level fully remote. I mean, that is unheard of. And it's one of those things where, that had had a massive impact on housing costs and I think people, I think that they can predict, they'll say like, oh well San Francisco, DC – that will always appreciate, we know that's gonna always appreciate. We don't know what's gonna happen, and we're telling people to put all their money there anyway.",
        "Jerusalem: Yeah. The fact that your property value is something means that, let's say we say  your property value is $500,000. That means that there's someone willing to pay that, hopefully multiple people willing to pay that property value. The higher and higher it gets, right? Eventually it's like, who can afford like a 2 million house? Like, very few people can afford that. And that's what we're saying with constantly appreciating housing prices, that there should always be someone new, ready to pay that price. And at some point, the dam breaks, right? Like, at some point that there's not gonna be enough people to pay for that.",
        "Jerusalem: I, I mean, I do think we're at a really bad inflection point here because people are  so frustrated and fed up because of homelessness in particular, but also housing costs that they're willing to turn to really, really counterproductive policies. And this isn't just me saying this as like, I think it's pretty inhumane to just criminalize people who have nowhere to live. That's definitely a big part of it. But also, like, it doesn't work. You're telling someone who's homeless, it's illegal for you to camp here. It doesn't actually give them anywhere to go. In DC there was like local reporting which showed that people at a new encampment were just people who had been dispersed from old encampments, like, you have to actually have somewhere for them to be, in order to tell them to leave.And, especially in California where there are not enough homeless shelter beds available for the population, it's kind of ridiculous to be like, oh, it's illegal for you to be here. Our attempts to criminalize poverty don't actually make poverty outlawed. Like, people are not poor by choice. And so it is one of those things which is really depressing, is that like, because we've really kicked the can down the road so much, at this point I'm not sure how much patience voters have for a solution which is really a long term one.",
        "Jerusalem: Yeah, I mean, a couple of responses there.  One is that it is the problem of regulatory constraints on building, housing infrastructure, other types of infrastructure. The truly libertarian response to that should be to allow for property rights, right? Like, if you own your house, you can paint it blue, you can, no homeowner's association or like overzealous local government can tell you you can't have your kid move into your garage. Like, that is the truly libertarian response here. And I think that's one of the things about this, this problem to me is that like, it should attract every ideology, like, leftists are in favor of building social housing building, uh, uh, and, and protecting lower income renters and, and in promoting a stable housing and rental environments for people.Conservatives are very opposed to government intervention in this space. Libertarians similarly have those kinds of reactions, in theory. But I think what it comes down to is, while everyone kind of has these, like, fancy and theoretical ideologies at the theoretical level, what really matters is structure of government. When you have a local government that is in charge of permitting housing, that has the power to block infrastructure in general, it takes just a couple people to block it all. And that doesn't matter if 98% of people are in favor. It just takes a lawsuit. You only need one person with a lawyer.And the question here is how we have allowed this structure of government to proliferate and has a lot to do with the fact that we have deference towards the legal system as being the best way to resolve these kinds of disputes. And also because we fetishize local government and treat it as if it is closer to the people because it is smaller, but really it's a lot less representative because many fewer people vote or engage.And so the really democratic outcomes, they don't happen at the local level. They happen at the state level or the federal level, or more so at the state level, federal level than they do there.",
        "Jerusalem: Yeah.  ",
        "Jerusalem: I thought Covid 19 would be much more of, like, a come-to-Jesus moment for a lot  of people. Like, I mean, especially with housing, right? What we saw with homeless folks, homeless shelters were terrified about how to shelter people, especially in the winter, while the spread of Covid 19 could mean death or serious disability, or a number of things for both the homeless population. But also it's community spread. If more people in your community had covid, it was a public health issue. It wasn't an individual issue. And what was great is that that spurred a lot of places to start investing in converting hotel space into homeless shelters. That was a double whammy for communities because hotels had been depleted. And so getting that kind of funding input from public sector was able to tide them over. And it also gave homeless folks a real place to go. A lot of times people are like, well, I know someone who rejected going to a homeless shelter. And you have to recognize that a lot of homeless shelters are gender segregated. So it means you have to separate maybe from your partner, or even your children in order to go to a homeless shelter. They don't allow pets. And that may seem like a joke to some people. Like, a lot of people don't expect to become chronically homeless. Like, I have a dog and if I thought I was gonna be homeless for a week or so, I wouldn't just abandon my dog because, you know, it's like, from one week from now I'm gonna have a new place to live. The apartment I'm gonna be is gonna open up. And then also, can be quite dangerous, right? Like, there's a lot of victimization that can happen in these spaces. But with a hotel room, you have privacy, right? There's like, there's a door, there's a place to go to the bathroom that's private, that feels safe and secure. So there's a lot of innovation that happened there, and thankfully we're seeing some places take that seriously and think about converting hotel space and other places into homeless shelters in the future.I agree with you. I think a lot of the times there's not a lot of solidarity here, which is sad, but I also think that it's not, you know, actually that important for solving this problem right now, because it is in everyone's interest that we deal with the housing cost problem. This is not something that is about charity for one person or another. This is gonna affect everyone. If there's not affordable housing for you or your kids where you need it to be, when we look at our universities, where there's no affordable housing for students or housing at all, like the rates of student homelessness have gone up. You're gonna send your kid to UC Berkeley, and they're not gonna have a place to live? Is that really the society, what we want? And, it really is going to become a systemic problem in every single sector, for higher education, for public health, for all these things.",

        "Thomas: Sure. So I'm the first year of the millennial generation, born in 1981 in suburban New  Jersey. Very much still in a culture where the principle of the one drop rule governs your sense of racial identity. So my father's a black man from the segregated south, from Texas, grew up mostly in Galveston under segregation.My mom's a white evangelical Christian from Southern California. And we were what is called today a multiracial family. But we didn't think of ourselves that way. We were, we were a Black family, and I kind of, in retrospect, had a uncomplicated way of thinking of racial identity. So I never really identified as biracial, didn't really have that terminology in my vocabulary until I was in my twenties.I grew up very much with this sense of race as a binary, a Black, white binary, either or. My first book is a coming of age memoir about hip hop culture and the street culture that's infused into the music that, I guess, promoted a kind of idea of racial authenticity that there was a proper way to behave as Black - as a Black male specifically.And so I - I wrote about kind of growing through this racial identity and then growing out of it in my first book, Losing My Cool. And I thought that that was basically how I would think about race forever, that Backness is more expansive than the way I had grown up thinking about it. But then I moved to Paris when I was 29, and I married a French woman who - it dawned on me - had blonde hair and blue eyes as my mother did, does. And it started to occur to me that if we had children, that we might have children who it would be very difficult to physically recognize as Black. You know, I had to recalibrate what I was prepared to do in raising a child and sending a child into the world with the kind of racialized thinking that I had grown up with, and to decide whether that was something to really be passed on.And so I thought, the physical presence of this child destroys the kind of fiction of race that I had grown up believing, and it makes me have to step back and question the categories I pledge allegiance to.",
        "Thomas: Very much so. And a kind of criticism that I receive sometimes is that, well, you know,  growing up, we're all performing in many different ways and teenage identity is something very much in flux and people are trying on different identities. And so to what extent was the racial performance that you think of as so profound, to what extent was that just normal teenage insecurities and things like that? And you know, that's a very good question, and I can't separate the degree to which some of what I'm thinking about is just the insecurity of teenagehood. But I was very much performing a kind of idea of black masculinity that I think was marketed and sold to my generation, the kind of racial performance that I very much would say I was doing when I was in school or at the basketball court or whatever was in tension with the kind of identity that I inhabited in my father's household. And I used to think that one was a more authentic Black identity, and that would be the one outside of my father's household. And the identity at home was something else than that. And the book was my resolving the fact of the expansiveness of Blackness and that they were not actually in a racial tension.",
        "Thomas: When I held my, my daughter Marlow in 2013 is when my sense of the way race  works fell apart. And to reiterate, I didn't think, here I have a white child. I thought this child is. Somewhere between 20 and 25%, Sene-Gambian, West African descended. No one in the street can look at her and perceive that. What does that mean to call that person white? What does it mean to call myself Black if I can produce a child that looks like that? I think that these categories don't contain us, and I suspect they might not contain other people as well. But we just happen to be living on the very margins where they fall apart.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, very much so. I just think that we're drowning in the boundaries of identity, of  abstract group categorization that oftentimes really oversimplifies the multiple identities that we always inhabit and, and flip around. And that speak to the expansiveness of our human experiences, you know, and we reduce everything to the idea of here I am, a mixed race Black man, but a Black man all the same, because a drop of Black blood makes a person Black because you can't be white because white is, is free and Black is enslaved. And I'm talking to a white man and you have privilege and I can't understand certain things about you and you can't understand certain things about me. Or we have to present ourselves that way to be fully respectful of the way the discourse is supposed to operate now, you're supposed to defer to me on certain matters, and that's the kind of gallantry that you perform for me, because we're supposed to understand you as having started out with certain advantages that are withheld from me.And I think that this is just not how human life works. And I think that it causes quite a lot of the problems that we're dealing with politically, intellectually, culturally. There's a real historical wound that I don't think we can downplay. But sometimes a correction can become an over-correction, and a solution to a problem can actually become, in many ways, a problem in its own right that rivals the thing it was trying to remedy.",
        "Thomas: Very much so. ",
        "Thomas: Very much so. I think that, and they don't start from the same motivation, but there is  a point at which a kind of anti-racism starts to reproduce the exact same categories of thought that race is the thing that's real and the thing that cannot be transcended starts to reproduce that in a way that would make quite a lot of sense to the actual racist.They just don't necessarily buy into the same hierarchical reasoning. But they start from a lot of the same presuppositions. And it actually gets you to a similar place. Richard Spencer believes a lot of the same things that you can hear the most prominent anti-racist, like Robin DiAngelo say. He thinks that whiteness is a thing that's very real and that curtains people like you off from people like me, and that those boundaries are what matter most in our interaction.I don't think that gets us to where we want to be if we wanna make a multi-ethnic society that allows individuals to flourish. So I come from a position that is somewhere in the center, and tries to avoid the kind of race essentialism that encroaches from both the left and the right. And that's a place that angers quite a lot of people.",
        "Thomas: Even if you take out the better or less than, which is what the racist would apply, a  racist might say. I think it's actually really good that Black people can dance really well. Black people dance well. That's insanely racist, and it's not even true because every single quality that you associate with a race, individuals can disprove that. To reduce the individual to the quality of the group is to diminish the individual.",
        "Thomas: All of that kind of thinking. It's so deeply problematic. But we all, we all slip into this  from time to time. And sometimes people will try to get out of the biological race essentialism, but they'll do something culturally or socially that essentially functions as though it's a biological reality. So ‘Black people behave this way, or Black people like these things, or Jewish people do this.’And it might as well be a biological effect because you socially construct it to the point that it's so limiting that it still diminishes the individual's capacity to surprise.",
        "Thomas: Well, I think that we need more kind of honest conversation the way you set this up  between people who are racialized in society as other, and, and people who are racialized as white and kind of occupy that. The way we've thought about race for so long is like a neutral space, like whiteness just is, and everybody else is a degree of deviation from that white, invisible norm.And I also don't think that, you know, racialized people, Black people, other types of non-white people have all of the answers and this conversation is going to have to be a dialog. You can have blind spots because you are Black. One of the things that Albert Camus, who's one of my favorite writers said that really stuck with me is that, you know, he was catching so much hell for being pretty quiet on the Algerian question, when Algeria was fighting for independence and Sartre and everybody were, were accusing him of shirking his responsibility as an Algerian to weigh in.And he said, and it's important to know he's a French Algerian, but he considered himself an Algerian. He said, ‘on the contrary, it's precisely because I'm from Algeria that I want to be quiet here because I think my identity can blind me to what might be the, the correct analysis.’",

        "Thomas: Yeah, I think that we won't achieve the kind of multi-ethnic societies that most of us  would like so long as we keep reproducing habits of thought that were passed down to us from the plantation, from the collision of Africa and Europe in the new world, through a fundamental economic oppression that created a class of slaves.I don't think that these are rehabitable categories. You can try to capitalize the B in Black, make white people live with the lowercase w. Those categories still imply a hierarchy that even trying to correct them only reinforces, doesn't actually change. I think we have to have fundamentally kind of new thinking about ourselves and each other.And having new ways of seeing ourselves in each other. We're gonna have to find new ways to talk about these things, and doubling down on identity is not working.",
        "Thomas: It's a constant negotiation. ",
        "Thomas: Between your idea of yourself and the identity reflected back at you from the  institutions and people you interact with. So I can't just say I'm anything, and that's the end of the conversation. But we can collectively decide to change the way we think about certain things. People often say, well, even if it's not rooted in biology, I, I'm attached to my identity as, as X. And I think you still can be. But I think you can say that a certain community of people created a certain music in a certain geographical location, and, and that's the tradition that you come from and you feel attached to that, but you don't have to actually go through the steps of racecraft that make that a kind of ethno-biological reality.",
        "Thomas: That's a great question. When does it take on that significance?  I think it takes on that significance when you simply reproduce the ways of thinking that are handed down to you. And it ceases to be that when you take the time to figure out who you actually are as an individual, the expansiveness of your humanity and what connects you to others. For me, that inkling of this happened when I was 19 years old and I read The Brothers Karamazov and I realized my inner states were being described by a Russian racist who lived in the 1800's and was a proselytizing zealot. He was able to describe the interstates of my being fundamentally in a way that the people who looked exactly like me and lived next door to me could not. That planted the seed of questioning, might there be something that is actually my identity that doesn't fit in this way of thinking that I've been told is the way the world works. So I don't know if that answers your question, but I think that thinking very seriously about who you are specifically is the first step out.",
        "Thomas: Well, that's the most common pushback I think I always get, is that this all is fine and  good until you step out in the real world and you're enmeshed in a social construct that has repercussions if you interact with a police officer or all these things. And that's true. And you know, I don't think that we have to have 100% buy-in to the kind of argument I'm making that we need to transcend race. But I think that norms can change and we can have more subtle ways of thinking of ourselves and each other than we do now. And there can be a kind of partial victory and there can be communities in which there is a better way of thinking about these questions than there tends to be right now.And so that's what really worries me about what's going on in, in elite spaces. In media, cultural, artistic, elite, corporate institutions, the lack of good thinking and new thinking on race that's happening in those spaces is - it's the opposite of what I would hope for. I would hope that we would have the best thinking on how to transcend race in the universities. And we actually have some of the most regressive thinking on racial categorization there, or in museums or in magazines now.",
        "Thomas: It's a good question, but you had mentioned earlier a very important word that we  barely touched on, which is class. And I think that we could clear up a lot of confusion about essentialism and racial categorization if we would, as a culture, spend more time dwelling on the ramifications of social class. And I wonder to what extent the sense of entrapment in racial categorization that that Black person who's having a different experience in life than both of us are – I wonder to what extent that's governed by their class position. And I wonder to what extent you and I can understand each other and can take certain ideas and practices and norms for granted that a working-class person in Mississippi not far from where you are now, would not be able to participate in even if they're white.",
        "Thomas: That's been my experience. ",
        "Thomas: I – to a degree more than most people that I socialize with now – I've, I've lived in  several different classes and I think that the working class Black kids that I grew up spending quite a lot of time with in my childhood had a lot more in common with the working class Italian kids that I grew up with in New Jersey than they do with the kinds of upper middle class and well-to-do Harvard-educated Black people that I encounter in adult life.",
        "Thomas: I agree with you. But I think a lot of things that matter are hard and are challenging.  I think it was really hard for a lot of people to change their thinking on who can marry or to what degree people can be openly gay in our society. And that's one of the most incredible things that I've ever seen is the speed, the rapidity with which an entire social norm could change in less than 20 years.The entire culture shifted on something like that. And so I think it's possible, and I think that was hard. And I think that's actually something that had buy-in from elites, certainly. But you can also talk to a lot of people of different class levels who now fundamentally think differently about sexual preference.",
        "Thomas: It is. ",
        "Thomas: That's right. I think that's a fantastic way of making the point.  Race is classed and class is raced. What you're talking about, the kind of jarring class transition, it can feel like a racial betrayal, because I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding of what the thing was that united us was a racial identity or authenticity. But in fact, what it was was a shared experience. Which is why it's so important to have many more kind of stories, many more kind of narratives of what it means to be X category so that you see the expansiveness. We need more expressions of what it means, and I was stuck in a single story growing up. And what I was pushing back against and recoiling from was this notion that I had to perform a single story, to have that negotiation between my sense of self and the others around me be validated.",
        "Thomas: Oh yeah. ",
        "Thomas: Right. I'm glad you brought that point up because none of this can work so long as  white people fundamentally believe that they're white and that that's a real category, and that makes them different from people who are considered non-white. You actually have to have white people cease buying into the racial binary to make any progress, especially when you just think about how many people in America are considered white and how many people are not. I mean, white people are still most people in America, so you need them numerically, if nothing else. But also because they set the terms of the racial binary. Whiteness is defined as not being that racialized Other. But I do think that, you know, somebody has to make a move first, and so rather than wait for white people to stop at some point in the future, Blacks and other non-whites might have something to contribute here by modeling how to transcend racialized thinking.",
        "Thomas: Absolutely. ",
        "Thomas: That's right. ",
        "Thomas: Well, even criminal justice and some of the material discrepancies benefit from being  looked at through lenses other than strictly racial lenses.",
        "Thomas: Black Lives Matter was a really interesting movement in raising awareness about the  degree to which people die in the custody of police far too frequently in this country, and a disproportionate amount of those people will be Black. The most disproportionate amount are actually Native American. But the most numerically are white. So I think that you can frame the issue as a racial issue. And that gets you so far.But it might actually be better to frame the issue as one that's universally applicable. We have a problem of American citizens dying and being abused in the custody of law enforcement that's really out of whack with Western country norms. And this is something that affects us all as American citizens, and we should all be concerned about this. And you can kind of do away with the racecraft.This is something that has been reiterated by people like John McWhorter or Coleman Hughes or Glenn Lowry. And they're coming from a Black kind of perspective that people don't often wanna hear. But for every example of abuse you can find that fits X race category, you can find it for Y race category also. You can find white people who have died in every imaginable way in police custody. That's not to say that there's not a history of real racism, and that Black people don't have every reason to feel particularly menaced throughout American history by law enforcement and also failed by government protections. That's all real. But I don't necessarily know that the solution is to only, like, focus on the racial lens as opposed to the other lenses that we can apply.",
        "Thomas: And you sound very reasonable saying that, but we often are being encouraged to  focus on only one. I think that we are in a moment where there is an extraordinary pressure to reduce everything to one. Here is the single lens, and it's every aspect of our coverage now. We're being forced to think about things in terms of identity. And it falls apart with the… the lightest scrutiny. The single lens.music The idea of rejecting racial identity might seem liberating. But for many Americans, racial identity doesn’t seem like something you can just opt out of. I’ll ask Thomas about this… after one last quick break.MIDROLL 2music ",
        "Thomas: It does make sense to me. You know, that resonated with me when I read Ta-Nahesi  Coates' Between the World and Me, a book that I profoundly disagree with on some levels. But when he said, you know, they made us a race, but we made ourselves a people. We made a culture and this culture is beautiful. And he described, I think, going through an airport, passing by another by Black guy, and the nod that they gave each other. And he just said, that's a beautiful aspect of being Black. And I participate in some of that culture and find it meaningful. You know, it's a cliche, but that nod is a real thing and it's nice. And I don't think that that has to be actually racialized to be meaningful and to be kept. But whether or not this identity was imposed on you, or this racial categorization was imposed on you, you can continue to reproduce something. You can take the N-word and try to make it positive or whatever you wanna do. That's your choice. But that doesn't necessarily mean that's the best strategy for transcending the initial harm. One of the greatest contributions America made to world culture is the kind of music that's rooted in the blues, that goes through jazz, that goes through R&B, gospel, hip hop. That's a contribution from the people who were enslaved in this society. They made the kind of world-defining culture that in many people's minds is synonymous with America. That's all beautiful. But that doesn't mean that being racialized as black through slavery wasn't a fundamental harm. Being made Black in a racist society was, was a harm that was done. I would also say, and this is not my original argument, James Baldwin is probably the most eloquent person to make this point. Being made white in a racialized and racist society is an enormous harm. I saw my white, racist maternal grandfather harm himself through his belief in a racial hierarchy and his position in it as a white man, and it destroyed his ability to have a fully loving relationship with his daughter.So I would say white people would benefit just as much as Black people from throwing off the racial harm of their white identity.",
        "Thomas: I think about it a lot. And I think sometimes of a kind of point that Albert Murray would  make, which is like at the end of the day, Black people have only ever been at most 13% of the population. So that kind of racialized solidarity is only gonna get you so far. In my way of thinking, organizing politically around racial identity in terms of numbers is always gonna be a losing proposition for Black people.And it's not really a kind of organizing principle that you would want to see white people reinvesting in. You always need coalitions and coalitional thinking. And so I would rather organize around values and shared goals than around shared depressions and histories of categorical thinking.",
        "Thomas: Right. I agree with everything that you're raising as a kind of form of ambivalence. I  have quite a lot of ambivalence myself. I really don't think of myself as somebody who wants to reduce very complex questions to very simple platitudes and solutions. And I realize for a lot of people, the kind of solution that I'm comfortable with isn't comfortable for them now, but I'm trying to raise questions and have conversations that I think are important without trying to just, in an oversimplified way, say that we should just not see race or things like this. I'm not trying to have conversation on that level. So your ambivalence is something that I really, that resonates with me. This is a really important thing that we should all be asking ourselves. To what extent are we really dealing with the weight of history? To what extent are we really wounded? To what extent are some of the things that happened to us about the way we've been categorized? And to what extent are some of the things that happened to us just the ordinary and inescapable disappointment, pain, hardship, difficulty of being human and being alive, trying to make meaning out of a life that is often not perfect and wouldn't be perfect, were you to have the racial wound addressed? And how much of the things that we think are so predetermined by our identity category, how much of that is just the real, what Albert Murray or, or Stanley Kurtz was called just the blues of being alive, the inherent blues of being a creature that's trying to make meaning for a very short period of time and will die?",
        "Thomas: Yeah, I land somewhere similar. I mean, I think that one of the best ways, or the most  obvious ways to fix, if not all of it, quite a lot of the racial question would be to address the economic inequality question. I think that in settings where people meet as more or less equals, they can be astonishingly diverse places where people actually interact with each other.So that's just to say that the class question, I think, is one that matters a lot and gets short shrift. And this is Adolph Reed's point and there's a kind of black socialist tradition of this, that the focus on race is actually an obfuscation from the thing that's really keeping us from achieving what would actually be the racial equality that we're looking for.",
        "Thomas: It's not sufficient, but I would say that that's still a very class-based social reality that is  also racialized. So France is also, you know, an aristocratic old country where, you know, the people who control the best opportunities and positions have always been white because the country wasn't even diverse until after the second World War. So it's very difficult to separate that as a racial question from the fact that the people who are white today are the people who have always been in positions of social prestige. I think it looks very similar to America, when you get into rooms where the people who are racialized as minorities are on equal social and economic footing with whites. Then you don't necessarily have the same kind of skin-based racism that you might imagine you would have if the society were truly a white supremacist society. If that makes sense. You have to have a kind of economic material concern to answering these questions. And what a lot of the discourse focuses on is the kind of permanent, identity-based race wound that can never be made whole, no matter what opportunities are extended or, or what outcomes begin to amass. There will always be this permanent wound that we must – I almost wanna say, remain loyal to. Because it's terrifying to imagine transcending the wound. It almost feels disloyal in certain ways. It's scary.",
        "I mean that I belong to a tradition, a generation, a group of people who are  committed to eradicating the violence from police prisons, surveillance, prosecutors, right? The entire carceral state, and committed to eradicating violence in our society at the same time, over time until all of this is obsolete.",
        "Derecka: Well, it depends on the people. I feel very lucky that there have been lots of  organizers, scholars, thinkers, people in our community who've been organizing around abolition for decades, quite literally before I've been born. And so I'm coming in literally on the tail end of so much of the groundwork that's been laid by people who've come before me. And just, how lucky am I to be an inheritor of that tradition? Right? Abolition has always been unpopular even since slavery, right? There were debates around whether there should be an anti-slavery movement or an abolitionist movement. There are critiques of abolition from the left, from the right, from liberals or conservatives.So usually the most progressive stances in our society have always been under fire because the status quo is much easier to maintain it. If you have a media, if you have corporations. So many people who have the power to maintain oppression, controlling the narrative and the money. And so, yeah, I don't know if I've been in the hot seat any more than anyone who has been fighting to do this work for decades, centuries, even. And I just feel lucky to be in their tradition.",
        "Derecka: Yeah. So I first learned about abolition as a concept, maybe as a child, right?  Because I learned about the abolition of slavery. I learned about the history of black people on plantations, who were running away to get free, who engaged in the insurrections, who were plotting rebellions, who were orrating who were traveling throughout the country building an underground railroad.And so my first contact with abolition generally was through the context of slavery, which is also the context in which many abolitionists today draw on when we talk about contemporary abolition is particularly in response to the prison industrial complex. But when I was in college, I would hear organizers and activists talk about abolition at meetings or protest. And I honestly just didn't even know what they were talking about. It's just hearing the word abolition or police abolition or prison abolition, or even the abolition of borders. I just didn't take them seriously. I said, oh, you want to abolish police? Like where, how, like why, what are we going to do with all the bad people? All of the horrible people? I mean, my response, my repulsion mostly came from a place of ignorance and just not really grappling or taking time to understand what these people meant when they were saying abolition. And it's not because I wanted to keep police, necessarily, or I wanted to keep prisons necessarily it's because like most people in this country, my ideas about policing and about prisons were largely unexamined. Right? I hadn't taken time ever to really think about where did police come from? What's their role, purpose, function in this society? Do we need them in the way that I've been conditioned to believe that we need that?And so I was dismissive and repulsive because I was just didn't take those activists seriously. And then years later, by the time I started studying and being pushed to think about abolition from other organizers and scholars and people who were in the community surrounding Cambridge, I was shocked to learn about the abolitionist project and still had lots of questions. I still have lots of questions. But it was very different from what I initially thought it was when I first heard it, you know, more than a decade ago.",
        "Derecka: Well, there are so many of us, when I say many of us, I mean, people who are a part  of what Elizabeth Alexander calls the Trayvon generation. Who watched Trayvon get killed. Watched George Zimmerman go free and have since continued to watch videos of police killings go viral. But in 2012, after Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman, me and so many other people across the country, we went into the streets to demand that the police arrest George Zimmerman, and we called that justice. We said that we wanted justice for Trayvon. And what justice meant at the time for me, and for many other people is that George Zimmerman not only had to get arrested, but also had to get convicted, right. That there also needed to be a change in laws, like stand your ground, that were basically helping lots of white men get away with murder.And so I watched organizations that eventually became the Dream Defenders. And I watched the formation of BYP 100. I watched all of these groups just catalyze a movement that was, the primary demand was to get someone arrested. And then from 2012 to 2014, 2015, and the aftermath of the Ferguson uprising, I watched the same people that I organized with, I demanded justice with, I watched them become police and prison abolitionists. I watched them grow and ask questions. I watched them become revolutionaries and engage in critical thinking and political education and form campaigns to close jails, to remove money from the police. And so what I really love about the book is that it gave me a little bit of space to talk about the political evolution of people like Charlene Carruthers and Phil Agnew. And I mean so many different people right now who we see espouse abolition as politics, but it didn't happen overnight.",
        "Derecka: Yes, absolutely. The word brand makes me a little bit nervous. So when they say my  particular brand of evolution, it's ironic because you're asking me about capitalism and I'm nervous about abolition becoming a brand. But I think about the tradition of abolitionists that I'm in. And we can go to somewhere like WEB Dubois who was very excited and who affirmed lots of white abolitionists like Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner for taking up the cause to help free black people from slavery. And W.E.B. Du Bois, he did something else in Black Reconstruction, right? He is also critical of white abolitionists who were committed to the rapid capitalist industrialization of the United States. He considered it just a huge flaw in their activism and in our organizing, you know, for black people. And so even the tradition of abolitionists that I see myself and it's related to W.E.B. Du Bois's critique of former abolitionists who were committed to ending oppressive institutions, but who are not critical or refuse to hold a serious analysis of the way that capitalism was becoming, rapidly becoming a destructive force in the United States.And so when I think about W.E.B. Du Bois, when I think about the black socialists and black communists, who said, we charge genocide in the 1950s, right? They were criticizing the US government and they were pointing to all of the violence in our communities, including police brutality through an anticapitalist framework.Right. And I think about that all the way down to people who are developing analysis around the prison industrial complex, and we read Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Mariame Kaba, or Angela Davis, right? People who espouse anticapitalist politics, because they know that capitalism creates so much inequality in the United States.We are looking at the coronavirus right now. You know, we have people who are losing jobs. There's an eviction crisis. There's so much more poverty. And yet billionaires are getting more money. And what happens with that inequality, prisons, police, prosecutors. They ultimately become the managers of that inequality.And so we can't just abolish the prison industrial complex. So we can't just end mass incarceration and keep capitalism intact. And so I see myself in that longer line of tradition. What has changed is the way that capitalism manifests. So it doesn't look the same as it did in the 18 hundreds or the early 19 hundreds. Right. We have new tenants of capitalism that we need to fight, you know, because it's at least attempting to convince lots of poor people, black people, people of color, indigenous people that you can work your way up in it. There's a lot of social mobility if we just rely on capitalism, we have politicians save a very capitalist to the bones, right? So we have to figure out how to fight the narrative that capitalism is a salvific economic option in this country because it's really causing so much devastation that the police ultimately manage.",
        "Derecka: Oh my gosh. ",
        "Derecka: Oh, my gosh. ",
        "Derecka: wait. They were getting paid and you were sitting there helping them volunteering. ",
        "Derecka: Well, thank you for sharing that story. And I'm so sorry that happened to you. It's  not fun, obviously, getting your important things stolen. When I was sick with COVID last year, I was too sick to bring my bike in out my car. And the next morning I went outside, my bike was gone. It was my birthday gift. I had only had it for a few months and I was so sad. And so, yeah. It's not fun to have things stolen. It sucks. It's tragic. And so I think that people hold onto the idea of policing for lots of reasons. I think one, like I did, it's largely unexamined. Police appear as normal neutral fixtures of our society for a lot of people like, oh yeah, we have teachers, we have post office workers. We have cops, we have counselors. They're presented as first responders. When cities try to raise money for a medical emergency services. What do you see, you see police, fire and paramedics, all listings. So they're interwoven as normal fixtures of our society, despite the violent origins of their history. And despite the continued practices that they do every day. I think that's one reason that I don't know if enough people have asked, why do we have, why is this the case that our society is set up like this, you know, and great thing about social movements and about activism, that it compels people to ask critical questions about the kinds of people we are and the kinds of society that we have, right. Someone had to ask, why is it that gay people can't get married in the United States? Or why is it that women can't get abortions in the United States? Right. People have to ask them, force these questions, because if you don't, then you can assume that's a very oppressive set of relationships that we have the very oppressive institutions that we have are normal. So we need more people to engage in activism so that we can compel others to think critically about what we have and ask to have something better.A second reason why I think we hold on to the idea of policing is because the people who continue to lobby to give more money to the police are people who also have lots of power. And they essentially present a dichotomy to people, you know, they've had their neighborhoods divested of services, people who live in ghettos and class-exploited neighborhoods, people who don't have democratic control over their schools. And then you have people in power saying, well, you're gonna experience crime and violence if we don't have police, wouldn't you rather just reform them? Right. And so what I think it's on abolitionists to explain is that, well, we're not only trying to make police obsolete. We're also trying to figure out actually how to prevent violence, how to prevent the violent mugging that you just described. Right. We're not trying to say, well, you know, someone can just come and take her book bag, and then there's not going to be anyone for you to call. That's not the goal of abolition. Abolition is at least the tradition I belong to. We're asking why are people selling book bags off of trains? Why does someone steal my bike out of my car? Right? Like, why is it that the overwhelming majority of people who experience theft in this country are people who are poor, right? The people who get the most taken from them are people who are poor, who are living in trailers, who are living in the apartment complex and project housing.And they're mostly are experiencing theft and robberies and burglaries from other people who are poor. So if we had less inequality, perhaps there would be significantly fewer muggings, or people wouldn't be lurking in the middle of night to take out a bike to sell it for whoever knows what, right. So how can we reorient our society to fight the massive inequality that exists because of capitalism, because of racism, because of ableism. Instead of just relying on police to be barely responsive actors to the inequality, which is what we have right now. And here's the thing, all of that, you said for three weeks, you were riding around with the police? The amount of labor that Brooklyn or the city of New York paid for, for those cops to do the patrol work with you, it could have bought you another laptop.",
        "Derecka: It could have bought you several laptops, several. And so we are literally, we're  getting police, we're paying them thousands and thousands of dollars to replace things that are a few hundred dollars. It makes no sense. It makes no sense, but instead you were doing ride-alongs and they literally, they put you in jeopardy of potentially identifying someone. You know, that person may be going to jail. Maybe they're going to get a record and then what's going to happen? They're going to get out of jail with a record. It's going to be hard for them to get a job. It's gonna be hard for them to get housing. And they're going to probably steal again, because they need to survive.Right? So it's like, well, how do we actually disrupt the cycle by addressing the actual inequality and not just using police to be responsive to it?music Liberal opponents to police abolition usually hold the banner for quote-unquote reform –  a catch-all term that can imply anything from the introduction of body cameras to setting up a civilian review board. But for abolitionist Derecka Purnell, reforms like these don't go far enough.I’ll ask her why, after a quick break.MIDROLL 1music ",
        "Derecka: for so many reasons, for so many reasons. We can look at diversity for example. Many of the police departments around the country are absolutely very diverse. New York City has a very diverse police department. Baltimore, St. Louis all have varied, diverse police departments, and still the brutality is still there. We can look at a place like Puerto Rico where maybe 100% of the offices there are Puerto Rican, and yet they are one of the most violent policing institutions that belong to the United States. And so diversity, what it does, unfortunately, it discourages people of color from filing complaints against cops, right? It's like, well, I don't know if this encounter was obviously racist because now I have a black cop who stopped me and frisking me. And I don't like it, but I don't know if I'm going to go to the police department and say, you know, what this black cop did was racist. And so we see where there's community policing and diversity, we see a decline in people reporting cops from misconduct. It has a perverse effect, one major reason. Second major reason many of these reforms don't work is that they don't get to the heart of what policing does, which is manage inequality. And so let's say I'm a, I'm a homeless person.I'm sleeping under a bridge and police come, especially if I'm in St. Louis, they spray water on the ground so that the ground freezes over to stop homeless people from sleeping in front of city hall. Let's say this, right? Let's say all those cops are white or all of those cops are mean, and they curse at people when they tell them to move off the sidewalk. Now let's say, let's do this with community policing. Let's make all of these cops so much more nice. Let's make them more friendly. They could bring water, they could bring donuts and hot chocolate to pass out to people who are homeless. At the end of the day, whether it's the most angriest, racist, violent cop, or whether it's the nicest politest, gayest, womanest, blackest cop. At the end of the day, their job is to move those homeless people from one part of the city to another, right? They're not undermining the homelessness. They're not finding people housing. They're not pushing back on inequality.At the end of the day, they're carrying out the interests of the corporations who occupy downtown centers, and they want to make sure that they're maintaining the aesthetics, the appearance, oh, this is a nice, fancy, neat looking downtown center. We can’t have homeless people with their blankets and our tents everywhere. So it doesn't matter if you have a subjectively better cop, right? With a good personality who volunteers on Sundays at church at the end of the day, your favorite cop is primarily responsible with enforcing inequality. So we can reform them so they can enforce inequality better. We could put body cameras on them so we can watch how they enforce inequality. We can have all of the volunteer programs, the coffee with the cops, books and badges programs. They can hand out ice cream. At the end of the day, what they're primarily doing is finding better ways to manage inequality.So community policing sounds great, especially if you've experienced being harassed, stopped and frisked, ticketed, sexually assaulted. If you've experienced militarized policing, if you've been teargassed like I have, and your options are militarized policing or community policing, hell yeah! community policing sounds great. It's like, give me that. Right? I want that. But those are false choices. Community police is a better, efficient way to obscure the true violence and function of policing, which is to manage inequality, locking up tens of millions of people every year. And the overwhelming majority of those people are poor. I don't need a nicer cop to lock up poor people. I need people who are committed to fighting inequality and fighting policing itself.",
        "Derecka: Yeah. I mean, that's a fair question. I think the first thing I would speak to right now  is Camden. So what happens with police reform. And I will absolutely call it copaganda, is that it zooms in on what changes have been made with policing in the city like Camden. What often gets failed to mention alongside policing, is that especially in Camden, is that the poverty rate in Camden fell, it dropped significantly at the same time that people were touting that all of these reforms in Camden was improving policing. They failed to mentioned that poverty had also declined in Camden because the state of New Jersey was trying to incentivize companies to move there in order to like catalyze the economy.And so when, again, inequality decreases, we see less violence because people aren't stealing bookbags from, like, young black girls getting off of trains in New York City. Right? So there was a drop, a decrease in inequality, but yet the inequality goes out the window, the poverty rate, all of that conversation goes out the window about how that actually reduces harm. And then the focus is, or look clearly, this was the police MO. All these other factors happened. If we look at the government. So accountability office when they analyze the results of the crime bill, they say, well, putting all these additional officers on the street, only yielded about a 2% reduction in what we call crime. What actually caused more reduction of crimes was all of these developments in education, early childhood education, job growth in these areas, in these different communities. And so what's bad usually about the police literature is that it looks at police in isolation and it doesn't take into account other economic programs that are happening. Other shifts in education that are happening, the rise of mutual aids in particular neighborhoods, even with black churches, the level of mutual aid and charity that black churches do in areas where violence is reportedly higher, none of that gets taken to account in these research studies where it says, well, we put 18 more cops on this block every day for the past year, right?So we can't just have such a narrow research focus because then we applaud the results of that without looking at the full context of what happens in that city.",
        "Derecka: I mean, by your own example, do we want police to be giving tickets to people who  are riding bikes who don't have bells, right? Cause right now that's the combination that we have. We have people who are still being ticketed for silly arbitrary offenses. We still have about 15,000 murder, homicides every year in the United States. I don't think that the combination is effective. And one significant reason — and this is related to the lack of context that affirms that more police presence  one significant reason is because police often sabotage alternatives to policing. And so we see where the street violence  interruption programs throughout the country, the ones that are not ran by police, police have an antagonistic relationship to them. Right. We see police spraying spray paint in different gang territory to catalyze violence. We still see the use of informants. Right? We see the surveillance list for people who haven't even done any harm, haven't done the crime, but yet they're on these watch lists. I don't think that's the society that I want to live in. I think that we can do much better than that and what we're continuing to pay police in billions, all of those resources could actually be shifted towards reducing the inequality that police are then sent to go and manage.",
        "Derecka: I don't think so. I don't think so for lots of reasons. One, what happened with Derek  Chauvin I wouldn't say is unprecedented at all. Yet, police still continue to kill more than three people a day. Even with the rise of police convictions, we still see them kill more than three people a day. Often when cops get convicted, sometimes they get prison time. And if they do, they don't get the same amount of prison time that lots of other people who commit similar offenses do, even though they're supposed to be technically holding up the law. So we see less punishment, less prison time for cops who are engaged in egregious behaviors. And then I'll say two more things about this. The accountability, especially with the police convictions, it doesn't necessarily take into account if a Supreme Court grants police with a power to make violent calls in split second decisions, right? The court says, look, police officers, they don't have time to be weighing what's going to be the full consequences of my actions if I need to stop violence, that I is alleging that is happening, right?'' I have the power to make a split second decision based on my best judgment about this particular situation. I get to deploy force or I get to shoot. I get to hurt someone and I have the power to do that with a split second decision-making that has been granted by the Supreme Court. So if the court says cops have to make split second decision-making in determining when to use force, do we think in that split second that the court says cops have all the time and they're going to say, wait, wait, wait. Before I pull this trigger, remember Derek Chauvin was convicted of killing George Floyd, right? According to the court's own logic, they don't have time to make those calculations. And so we're trying to assume that the punishment that they're going to receive through a court conviction will then offset what the Supreme Court says that they don't have to consider. So that's not going to work. The second reason that's not going to work, is that again, we can use Derek Chauvin. Let's say that Derek Chauvin, he's going to go to prison I think for 20 years. The next cop who puts his knee on someone's neck over using a ledge, counterfeit $20 bill, let's say that person doesn't die. Let's say they live. Let's say they live and they go to a hospital. Or let’s say they live and go straight to jail. Let's say a cop does it for five minutes instead of 10 minutes. Right. Nothing's going to happen. There would be no protests, no uprisings. 20 million people are not going to go into the street every time a cop harms someone by putting their body into their neck, if that person does not die. And so if we only can count on convictions and accountability and that justice when someone is killed by the police and not the daily mundane stops and frisks, hits, assaults, intimidation, that's what’s at stake, right? Not the spectacular killings that go viral, but the everyday nature of policing, that is what's at stake. And then, so the accountability, it doesn't speak to how violent everyday policing is. And then unfortunately using those spectacular cases to try to stop police from being so violent, it's just not going to lead us to a lot of success.",
        "Derecka: Well, I want to respond quickly. So I don't know if that statistic is accurate that the  murder rate increased by 30%. and the murder rate has also been historically low over the last, like 30 to 40 years. ",
        "Derecka: And there's also disputes around the 30% figure from the FBI and from the New  York Times. So, yeah, I didn't, I didn't want to just respond to the question without contextualizing again the statistics.",
        "Derecka: I think what’s also very specific even about the murder rate that is jumping is the  context of which is jumping. And so I know that since COVID has happened, we have experienced deep deep deep inequality. We see people lose jobs. We see people lose homes. We've seen the government for several months give people $600 or $1,200 to live on. And so the more inequality that we expect in this society, the more violence and harm that's going to happen as a result of it. And so with a rising inequality, I am shocked, honestly, that violence isn't higher than what it is. Right. I am honestly shocked. I think if it had not been for the robust mutual aid and sharing and interventions that people have tried to do for each other. You know, I don't know where the violence rate would be.So we can't look at that murder rate out of context. Right. And even with the responses to COVID, the police has still been getting more and more and more funding, right. The police, businesses, like they continue to get funded. Sometimes it's so tragic to me knowing what has happened in the last year with the spikes in the homicide, like yeah, we have to absolutely be responsive. But here's the thing. There are nearly a million cops, so like 700,000 cops, there's 18,000 law enforcement agencies. And they all got huge grants from the federal government to do policing. Now, if policing is inadequate to the spike in murders, why do we think that more policing will then contribute to a decrease? Like why do we think that? Just logically it doesn't even make sense. Right. And so let's say that there is a 30% spike in murder rate. Well, why? Well, because of the inequality that we've experienced during the pandemic, and rather fighting to make sure that people can stay in their homes, that they get more assistance. What do we see? We see the expiration on eviction moratoriums. We see states deciding to reopen prematurely. 2000 about people who earn money and resources for their families. We're talking about caretakers and babysitters and teachers and friends and loved ones, right? So we're seeing more vulnerability and more precarity. And until we have an actual robust, courageous response to the pandemic, the violence is going to continue and we cannot police our way out of it. Hell, police are refusing to even get vaccinated. They are boycotting vaccines. They're contributing to the crisis. And then they're being paid to go, manage it.And so I think it's absolutely tragic what's happening right now. And I'm again, so grateful for all of the organizers and organizations who have been committed to helping people pay rent, to pay their mortgages, to feed themselves, to feed their children, to come up with pods so that students can learn when schools were closed, I am so grateful for organizations that passed out masks at the time where the federal government were telling people not to buy a mask. Or school districts were penalizing students who were coming to class with masks on. I am so grateful because had there not been a robust community based response, I think the violence would be even higher. Abolition is not to be anti-accountability or pro violence. What we're saying is that police isn't working. So we need to come up with better robust responses to inequality and to policing because as long as we choose to invest in the latter, then inequality is going to continue and we're not going to actually get to the root causes of harm.music That all sounds great, but… would any of this actually work? That’s a typical follow-up question that an abolitionist might hear – maybe even from a progressive. What about people who are just… determined to steal, vandalize, or hurt people?After one last short break, I’ll ask Derecka: would abolishing police make us  less safe?MIDROLL 2music ",
        "Derecka: Well, if I had to make an assumption about the kind of person who took the bike for  my car, I would assume that they probably don't, I don't know, own a home or have lots of resources and wealth. I would assume that they're not lurking the streets, like trying to steal bikes from people's cars because they live a comfortable life. If I had to make that assumption. When I used to steal from my mom and from my grandmother, it was because I didn't have money. Like I don't know why we mystify why people commit harm. Like when I do these trainings with abolitionists groups, I ask them, I say, raise your hand, you know, if you have ever been a victim of, like, theft, if someone has ever stolen from you, everyone raises their hand. And then I'll say, raise your hand if you've ever stolen from somewhere. And then people will like go raise their hand. Everyone will start laughing. And then eventually you will see that people steal from each other for lots of different reasons.And so, I don't know, I'm a person of faith, I guess I'm a Christian or whatever. I think that there is like bad things that people do. The overwhelming majority of violence is not because they're just people who are born that way. And if, so, one question I do ask to those people who will say, you know, some people are just evil. Some people are just wicked, I'll just ask, well, do they all just happen to live in the United States? Right? When we look at the level of mass shootings in this country, compared to other countries, do all the people who are just born evil, just all happen to live here, or is it that we have more guns that we have people in this country. And we have a Congress who refuses to do anything about that. Right. Like why are there 15,000 homicides here every year and not in other places similar populations? Why is it that the inequality is so massive here and not in other parts of the world, right? Why is sexual violence against indigenous people so high, you know, in the United States? So it could just be the case that, yeah, there are just evil people in the world. They're all just born in the United States, but I don't think that's true. don't think that's the case. I think that we are deeply socialized in the United States around violence. And what abolitionists are trying to do is undermine that socialization and put forward a different way of being in the world and it's not going to happen overnight. We're not going to eliminate 14, 15,000 murders overnight— homicides overnight rather, but what we can do as well, we can change the social relationships in the United States. So that by the time we actually get, I don't know, down to a thousand homicides or 200 homicides, maybe we can have better accountability in a way that's caring and thoughtful in the way that actually might prevent other harm or actually might take it account the real circumstances and offer some relief for the survivors and the person who caused the harm. Maybe we'll have more time to create a better system of response rather than the one that we have now, because we have, again, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of cops, and we still have so much sexual violence and so many homicides, and it's just an inadequate response to the harms of our nightmares.And so that is why I'm excited about what abolitionists are fighting for. And I know it's going to take time to get there, but I think it's more than worth the pursuit.",
        "Derecka: I would say it's more than just a dream. I think that there are lots of things that are  happening that can be considered abolitionist, right? So abolition is not just simply the eradication of the institution of policing or mass incarceration or the carceral state. It's also building up the kinds of people, neighborhoods, relationships, planet that we all deserve and that's always happening. Right. And so in terms of a timeline, there are different people who are fighting on different timelines for broader visions that lead towards an abolitionist future. So when I listen to climate justice activists fighting to stop emissions or fighting to stop the increase of earth's temperature by four degrees in the next 10 to like 30 years, that has abolitionist implications because the more that the planet heats up, the more there's going to be climate refugees, the more chaos there's going to be across borders. The more that governments are going to deploy police and the military to go be responsive to them. Right. So I will think of something like that as a very specific timeline that has abolitionist implications. And so when we think about abolitionists' relationship to lots of different struggles for justice, some of them do have concrete times. Others, it really depends. Do I think that I'm going to be alive to see the total eradication of the prison industrial complex? Absolutely not. I'm not going to be here. I, my children aren't going to be alive. You know, maybe my grandchildren, if we still have a planet by then. But what I hope is that I am doing what it takes right now, during my brief time on this planet to make sure that the foundation is being laid to make it easier for the next group of people who are fighting to reduce resources from the police, who are fighting to reduce our reliance on the police who are fighting to reduce the reasons why people think they need police. And everything I just listed — all of that's happening right now. And it's going to continue to happen over time. It's just about whether people are going to sabotage that by continuing to give money to the police.",
        "Derecka: Yes and no. Interestingly, what used to at least feel so overwhelming to me, was  fighting or stopping climate change. I was like, I don't know. I think we're too far gone. Like it's too late. But the more that I read, the more that I met climate justice activists, the more that I studied and struggled alongside them, I was like, oh yeah, we actually can do this. This can happen. When people say we need to abolish the police. I'm sure that makes you feel like, whoa, what are you talking about? That's what I used to feel about with climate change. And so it absolutely is going to feel overwhelming. I think what gives me a lot of inspiration is to know that there are so many movements in which the impossible seemed impossible, from the abolition of slavery to women's suffrage, to some of the demands and gains from the civil rights movement, you know, to the fight for the eight hour work day, the fight for social security, all of these struggles that we benefit from right now, they once seemed impossible. Right, there are abolitionists, insurrectionists who fought to end slavery who never got to be free, who never got to experience it.And it is in their tradition and their legacy that I'm just like, wait, you know, I may not be able to see this, but it's so important for me to do what I need to do now, because that's the tradition that I come from. And that's where I learned. So there's that. The part where I am a bit curious or pessimistic, where I'm just wondering like, wow, is this going to manifest in the way that I hope it does is actually around white violence. I remember when Sandy Hook happened and a white gunman walked into an elementary school and killed white five and six year olds, and nothing radically changed about gun violence in this country. Like nothing. I was like, oh, y'all are pretending that this society is so progressive. Y'all are pretending that you really care about violence, that we need police to come and be first responders when these mass shootings happen. But you aren't committed to even saving white five and six year olds. Like what does that literally mean for everyone else? Not only in this country, but in this world. And so I have a deep sense of pessimism and anger towards the idea of the same people keeps telling us, we need to fund more police in order to be responsive to violence. Actually won't do anything courageous to stop the rampant gun culture in the United States. And that angers me.",
        "Derecka: Yeah, of course. ",
        "Derecka: Oh, wow. This is so good. This is so good. I've been thinking a lot about invisibility  There's this, you know, like the social media thing about what it means to be seen and black women are not seen, and we celebrate and applaud black visibility and black mobility, but I'm actually very curious. About what invisibility will look like? Like what does it mean to not feel like a target or not to feel like you have to be tasked with breaking barriers, even within your family or outside your family? So I imagine, a world where black women in particular get to live very normal, exciting lives or mundane lives if they choose to. I imagine that they have new kinds of problems, right? That's the world that I'm ultimately fighting for. How do we get new kinds of problems? So many of my friends, they want to be partnered, young black women, you know, in their thirties, early forties, they want to be partnered. And I always tell them like, girl, you need to become an abolitionists because mass incarceration is disappearing, a million black men who you are attracted to. Right. And so it's so, so, so sad to know that it seems like many of our options have been stifled by misogyny, by patriarchy, by capitalism. So in that future, I imagine lots of options, different kinds of relationships. Intimate relationships, different kinds of friendships. I imagine black women being able to experience love that's not predicated on whether they'll be able to have health insurance, right, in a marriage or a house because their husband's making more than them. Or, I imagine a society where there's no private property and we get to experience lives based on, So for example, I think about Airbnb all the time. And how Airbnb, you know, it gentrifies communities, it displaces poor communities. And, you know, we have companies who are buying houses and flipping them just so they can be Airbnb. And I was like, wow, after the revolution, what are we going to do with all of these mansions? I want something where you don't have to rely on an income to experience beauty. Right. I want someone to experience what it feels like to wake up on a coast for a couple of weeks and watch the water hit the side of your window. I want everyone to be able to experience that. I want us to think about travel differently. If you want to go from New York City to Miami, you can take a high-speed train and get there in a couple of hours.And once you get there, there's robust quality childcare for you to drop your kids off. Right? I want all of that and so much more, and I'm very jealous of the people who will be able to live in that kind of future.",

        "Derecka: and you saw the train, right? You saw the mansions right. We all get to rotate. We  all get to eat.",
        "You know, it was the world's weirdest sabbatical project. I had timed  everything wrong, so I had just finished a different book when I got a sabbatical and I was sort of flailing around looking for things to do, and I had heard about this reserve officers program and it had just seemed so strange to me that a big city police department would let you volunteer to be a cop, it’s nuts, you know, and send you through the police academy and give you a badge and a gun and arrest powers.And I was so struck by how strange this was and I. You know, I've worked at the sort of margins of policing issues at different points in my life, but it's such an opaque culture to people who are outside of it. It's not unlike the military, you know, unless you happen to be married to a police officer or have someone in your immediate family.You know, most of us don't know anything about police. We think we do, because we see them on TV and we see them on the streets, but we don't really know, well, what are they taught? How are they trained? What do they say to themselves when they get up in the morning about, you know, what story are they telling themselves about what their job is and why they do it?So it just seemed like an incredible opportunity to be on the inside of this very opaque culture.Sean Iling: I have always been fascinated by how cops conceive of themselves and their role, and I want to know what you learned about cops when you became one. You know, what does the story cops tell about themselves to themselves?Rosa: Well, there are several and they, they kind of interlock. One thing I discovered was  when you ask most police officers why they became police officers, there are two stories that you hear over and over and over again. One of those stories is, I or someone very close to me was a victim of a serious crime, and I want to protect other people from having that happen to them or help them if it happens to them.So that, that's one story. And the other story you hear over and over is, I was heading in the wrong direction. I was going to end up in jail and a police officer took me under his wing or cut me a break and gave me some advice, or became a mentor, and it changed my life and I want to do that for other people.And I say that because I think there are people who are bullies, who become cops because they want to be bullies with legal authority and a gun. But the vast majority of police officers go into the occupation for pretty idealistic reasons, and that's very central to their image of themselves. They don't get up thinking I'm one of the bad guys.They get up thinking, I am one of the good guys. I. In this occupation to protect and help people and, and that belief is really quite deep. They then often get very cynical, however, as they go through their careers, and partly of course, that's because people don't call 911 when they're happy. You know, they call 911 when something is really wrong and they're angry, they're in crisis. Something terrible has just happened. So police see the worst of. over and over and over and again, again, every single day they see people at their most horrific, they see people who are drunk. They see parents beating their children. They see domestic violence. They see stabbings. They see children who are dead of overdoses.You know, it's just, and they can get very, very cynical and, and it's easy, I think, for them to start thinking, I don't know, are these people even worth helping? That attitude can kind of invade them. You know, I think there are a couple of other pieces. They get inculcated in them at the academy and it stays with them throughout their career as this sense of they're in constant danger.That they live in a society where everybody and their brother has 16 guns between them, and any encounter could turn lethal in a millisecond, ",
        "Rosa: and that really affects how they go through the world. That sense of people hate me  and I'm in constant danger. And then add to that, in the last few years, All of the media attention on police killings.This country has way too many police killings. It's insane. It's terrible. But that being said, you know, studies suggest that the vast majority of them will never even point their weapon at someone in their entire career. Much less, shoot someone, much less kill someone. And so the average police officer tends to feel like I am very misunderstood.Our occupation's very misunderstood. Everybody thinks we're these brutal thugs. I've never killed anybody. I, you know, I never wanna kill anybody. And that sense of being embattled and misunderstood. Then also, you know, you get the initial idealism, the cynicism, the fear, and the sense of being misunderstood.",

        "Rosa: They don't by and large, I mean, obviously I think it's important to say that cops are  humans, and they're not homogeneous. I've made some generalizations. They don't apply to everybody. But that being said, I think the average cop, it's part of that feeling of being misunderstood that the average cop would probably say everybody is blaming all police because of a few bad apples.Most police officers are not gonna go the next step and say, well, you know, maybe there's something about systemic racism and our role structurally, which also is part of the problem. You know, some do. Some do. Absolutely. You know, I know a lot of police officers who do, but I think that next move is not one that comes naturally.I, you know, I have a lot of police officer friends who are on Facebook and just looking at their comments about the killing of Tyree Nichols in Memphis. There's a tremendous amount of, those officers should go to jail. How could they have been hired in the first place? People like that make it hard for everyone.They make it hard for us to do our jobs. So very often that's their sense is that most of us are good. There are a few bad apples, and they make it hard for everybody else.",
        "Rosa: I mean most of policing, and this is one of the dirty little secrets of policing, most of  policing does not involve crime. Most of what most police officers do. Most of the time involves responding to people complain because their neighbors party, it's too noisy. There are kids hanging out in the back alley and they're scared to go out and put the trash out cuz they're worried that these kids might have bad intentions and might attack them or something.They're people who are upset because their neighbors, you know, leaving crack pipes in the hallway. Their domestic disputes. Parents are mad that their kids didn't come home on time. People are mad that their boyfriend didn’t pay his share of the rent. And it's things like that and because we live in a society that has largely abandoned poor communities, and particularly poor communities of color, because we live in a society that has radically, drastically, embarrassingly, underfunded, every important social service, from education to mental health care, to transportation, to job creation, the police are often the only people available to call. So neighborhoods are overpoliced, partly because they're under everything-elsed, you know? And so somebody's in the middle of a crisis, even one of these things that, as I said, doesn't involve a crime. And there is one phone number in most American jurisdictions that you can pick up and call and someone will show up at your door fairly quickly, and that is 911, and it's gonna be a police officer.We don't, at this moment, in most places, have any alternative to that. And so from the perspective of a police officer, they can feel like I spend all day, every day trying to help people with their ridiculous problems, which are not what I was trained to do. And the good ones help with empathy and compassion and concern and, and don't feel aggrieved by it.The bad ones do feel that's not fair, why should I have to do this? I'm not a social worker, I'm not a medic, I'm not a whatever. But either way, police feel like I'm not running around looking for people to shoot. That's crazy. On the contrary, I go where I'm told to go, I didn't create this system. I didn't decide, hey, let's underfund education or whatever. I didn't decide. Let's have these particular rules and regulations. I go where I'm told and where I'm told to go is where people in the community call 911 and ask me to go. And so there's that sense of feeling misunderstood. And I think the thing about structural racism and economic inequality is that it's hard to see.You know, it's really easy to villainize a person. And it's really hard to villainize 10,000 small decisions that cumulatively add up to a situation where people are hopeless and poor and have mental health issues that go unresolved for years and years and substance abuse issues. And so for police, I think they can start feeling like, what's the matter with these people? Why don't they just kind of pull their socks up and get their act together and look at all those other people out there, CNN, who think I'm this bad guy when all I do is I spend my time cleaning up other people's messes. You know, that being said, roughly a thousand people a year are killed by police in the United States, some of those killings are, are legally justified. You know, some of those really are self-defense or defense of others. Others of those shootings, and probably, unfortunately, the majority of them, the vast majority are probably preventable, and some of them are straight out homicides by police. But there are 750,000 police officers in the country a tiny fraction of them tend to be involved in excessive force cases. And so for most police officers, that feels like that's got nothing to do with me. Why don't people like me? And it's very hard to see two things, I think one, it's very hard to see that even if it's very rare. The way the occupation is structured contributes to that thousand-ish number, and that's still a very high number compared to every other country in the world.But also that it's not just the dead people, you know, it's all the people who get yelled at, who get humiliated, who get frisked when they were just mining their own business. It's all the people who have a thousand smaller interactions that are painful and remind them of inequality.",
        "Rosa: Yeah, that's a technical term. The under everything-elsed, that's what we call it in the  legal academy.",
        "Rosa: This is where this actually intersects with the sort of defund, the police movement.  Most cops don't want to be defunded, but if you ask a cop, are you the right people to be doing A, B, C, D that you spend 75% of your time doing, they would go, of course not, why can't the city fund those other things so I don't have to be doing them?",
        "Rosa: Sure. Yeah. They tend to be hierarchies that are modeled on military command  structures, you know, so there's a commander, they're captains, they're lieutenants and sergeants, and then the lowly patrol officers beneath them, and those commanders are themselves in a hierarchy that goes up to assistant chiefs and chiefs and so forth.So it tends to be a very rigid and hierarchical organizational structure. The training in most jurisdictions is kind of like a, a bad caricature of a 1980s marine boot camp. I mean, the military boot camps are not as boot campish as many police academies are anymore because the military figured out that this is maybe not a great way to train people if you want them to be developing critical thinking skills.",
        "Rosa: Well, if anybody saw the movie Full Metal Jacket or things like that where you've got  the drill surgeon, he's, you know, screaming, you maggots, get down, gimme 50. You know, there's a little bit of that. And DC is not, by any stretch, is not by any stretch the worst. In fact, it's probably one of the better ones.You know, it's a relatively progressive police department. But even so, the rules at the academy are, you don't, other than to greet people by saying, you know, good morning, sir. Good morning, ma'am. Recruits do not speak unless spoken to. If they do something wrong, you know their boots aren't shined, right? Or they, they, it's a, you know, often punishment based, it's, it's, get down and do more pushups, or you've gotta run around the academy five times.So it's very heavy emphasis on hierarchy, discipline, and punishment. A lot of yelling.",
        "Rosa: Yeah, to some extent. And it's certainly, I think it's fair to say that the people who  become police officers who previously were in the military, often the people who are rolling their eyes most at this ",
        "Rosa: And sort of saying, you know, we don't do this in the Marines anymore. This is silly,  but okay, fine, whatever.You want me to do more pushups, I'll do more pushups. You know, and needless to say, I, I think it's, it's just such a, Terrible message, right? Because the message of being in the police academy being told you don't speak until you're spoken to. You say, sir, ma'am, you get yelled at a lot, and if you do wrong, you're punished with physical pain, pushups or running, or whatever it might be.That message is that people who have power can inflict pain on people with less power. And then if police officers go out into the community and take that message with them, and most of them don’t but too many of them do. That translates into a lot of people who they're screaming at or shoving and not really caring very much.And again, I don't think that's true of most police officers, but that's not the same as saying it's because they're just a few bad apples. You know, it's not most police officers, cuz luckily most people manage to come through that kind of training with more of their humanity intact. But, it's a kind of training that could not be better designed to produce people who will be abusive towards the general public.",
        "Rosa: Yeah, well one of the most influential short articles in the policing universe of the last  20 years or so was a think piece that was done by a woman named Sue Rahr and was published initially, I think as a white paper by Harvard's Kennedy School, and Sue Rahr is the former commander of the Washington State Police Academy, trained all their state law enforcement agents, and she's a former sheriff in Kings County, Washington. So she'd spent years as an officer herself, and her paper was called Warriors versus Guardians. And she really took issue with this sort of warrior mentality and said, we need to try to reconfigure police training and police organizations to get police to think of themselves as guardians rather than warriors, and thinking of yourself as a guardian does not mean that you don't train in defensive tactics. It does not mean you don't learn how to shoot a gun. It does not mean you don't learn how to do those things. But it means that we place much, much, much more emphasis on saying to you, you know, those are the absolute last resorts and what you should be thinking is that you're out there to be a protector, and every now and then a protector will have to use coercive means. But your primary job is to keep people safe, ensure people's wellbeing and keep them safe. And I think that that launched a conversation within policing that is still going on that's a really important one. And one of the points that Sue Rahr makes is that in her program that she ran in Washington State, they actually increased the amount of time spent on defensive tactics. And her argument was part of the reason that so many police officers pull out their guns is that they're scared.They don't think they can handle themselves physically and they think they need to pull out their gun to even the odds and her take was the more we give them the physical self-confidence to think I'm okay. You know, I'm not gonna be beaten to a pulp, you know, I can handle myself, the less likely they are to panic and pull out that gun.",
        "Rosa: Absolutely. Yes. Policing is a dangerous job relative to accountants and law  professors, but it actually doesn't even make the list of the top 10 most dangerous occupations in the US.",
        "Rosa: Okay. Policing does not even make the list of the top 10 most dangerous  occupations in the United States, which are things like being a roofer. It's a really bad idea to be a roofer, folks, because people fall off those roofs and they, they die. It's a very dangerous occupation. Fishermen, sanitation workers, they're hanging onto the backs of trucks, incredibly dangerous jobs.Policing doesn't make the list of the jobs where you're most likely to die. That said, to be fair, the sanitation workers and roofers who die usually aren't shot or stabbed. They're, you know, they have accidents, but even when it comes to intentional harm, taxi, limousine, you know, Uber drivers are at more than twice the risk of being homicide victims on the job than cops.",
        "Rosa: And yet you don't see a kind of army of we need to have Kevlar vests and AR  fifteens for all of our Uber drivers cuz it's so dangerous. So it's dangerous, but not nearly as dangerous as police officers tend to imagine.music How can we better prepare cops for the realities of police work? I’ll ask Rosa Brooks about this… after a quick break.MIDROLL 1Music",
        "Rosa: Yeah. ",
        "Rosa: So there are a few studies that do suggest that police with college degrees are less  likely to be involved in excessive force situations, but it's impossible to untangle that from the fact that police with college degrees start out, they're usually a little older than the other officers.",
        "Rosa: Because I think you're right that there are wonderful police officers who don't have  that formal education because the skills and the judgment really don't have anything to do with formal education. They have to do with problem solving abilities and deescalation abilities and communication skills. I do think that when one is able to sort of shift the frame to guardian, And emphasize to police officers, you know, that is your most fundamental job.Your job is to try to walk away from every situation, leaving people feeling heard, feeling respected, and feeling like they're a little better off than they were when you came into that situation. That's your job. And the more academies shift to that kind of a focus, I think the better off they are. And again, that's not inconsistent with don't be an idiot.You know, you don't need to walk alone into a dark alley where you have no idea who's in it. You know, it's the same things that we, we all tell, we tell our children, we tell our friends. Right. If there is a domestic violence complaint and the dispatcher says that there are weapons involved you, maybe you don't walk up the front steps.Maybe you kind of walk around the house a little bit first and you kind of put your ear to the window to see if anybody's shooting before you walk in. You know that there are common sense things that absolutely police officers need to practice and learn how to do, because. You know, as you said, we live in a gun saturated society.People shoot each other, they shoot at police officers. You know, you can't discount those threats. But at the same time, if you let them dominate, you are going to end up using force. A lot of times we don't have to.",
        "Rosa: And we also have a legal framework in this country that's extremely permissive  towards police and that’s part of what makes it very difficult to hold police officers legally accountable that the court's jurisprudence very much emphasizes, we don't wanna second guess police officers. They have to make split second decisions.We're going to evaluate the use of force from the perspective of, well, what would a reasonable police officer have done in that split second? And so that ends up a contributing factor along with their decisions on qualified immunity that make it very hard to hold officers accountable. And I, I always tell my students, they say, well, we think police should respect people's constitutional rights.And I tell them, police officers who respect constitutional rights as the Supreme Court has interpreted them, can still do a tremendous amount of harm. That constitutional in the US framework is not the same as good.",
        "Rosa: Qualified immunity is essentially, it's a doctrine created by the courts that basically  says if somebody's an official, they're an employee of state, local, or federal government, and they're acting in their official capacity, that generally speaking, they should be protected from being sued civilly for what they did as part of their job.Of course, then the argument is, well wait a minute, excessive force is not part of anybody's job, but the court has the way they have interpreted this. As they've said, yes, officers can be sued in their personal capacities, and qualified immunity will not kick in if what the officer did violates a quote, clearly established constitutional norm.but then they go ahead and they define clearly established as meaning that a prior court, in a virtually identical case, said that what they did was wrong, which in turn means that you get all these situations where a police officer from any kind of common sense perspective has done something egregiously clearly wrong, and the court will look at it and they'll say, well, we don't see that any previous court said that this was clearly wrong in this identical situation.So therefore, even though we think it was wrong, we don't think it was clearly established that it was unlawful. And so the officer gets immunity from civil suit.",
        "Rosa: Yes.  ",
        "Rosa: Poorly trained, scared people. ",
        "Rosa: It is to some extent at least, yes. The length of police training in many European  countries is three years. It's treated like a university degree before you're out there on the streets. Um, in the US, most departments DC it's six months of training. In New York, it's roughly the same, but there are jurisdictions in the US where it is six weeks, not six months. Six weeks, and you're out there with your gun and your badge and your arrest powers.And even in places where it's six months, like DC. I was actually talking to a, a DC police officer this morning who was lamenting exactly this. He said, it's like a joke. You know, you never get refreshers. The, the mandatory refresher training is brief. It's usually a bunch of PowerPoints. You re-qualify on your gun at the shooting rage, and you're good to go again.And it's not. The military has an adage, you fight how you train, meaning that if you haven't trained over and over and over for scenarios, you're not gonna be prepared. And I think the same is true for policing. The trouble is it's really expensive and hard to train people really well, right? It would take several years.You have to do lots and lots of role play and scenario based training. You want people to really internalize better responses to things, and it's not something. That Americans tend to wanna spend money on, especially right now, you know that there's a lot of cynicism, Oh, training that's not gonna do any good.So then it becomes kind of a, a vicious circle. The recruiting piece is also a vicious circle. If you go on YouTube and you Google police recruiting videos, The majority of what you're gonna find out there is gonna be police departments that recruit with videos that involve people jumping out of helicopters and smashing doors down and tackling fleeing suspects.Well, if that's your message to the world, you're gonna recruit people who wanna go tackle fleeing suspects and smash doors in, and that becomes kind of self-fulfilling if you're recruiting and saying, this is what being a police officer involves. Involves a lot of force, it involves a lot of physical activity, military vision of policing.The people who are attracted to that probably are exactly the wrong people for policing. Whereas if you present policing as a, as a service profession, you know, as a a helping profession, you attract a different kind of people. But right now we're at a moment when police departments all over the country are having a terribly difficult time recruiting anybody. Just keeping their numbers up. Just replacing people who leave and retire, because right now people think, oh boy, who would wanna be a police officer? Either you don't wanna do it because you think, why would I wanna join this violent, militaristic organization that hurts people?Or you think, well, I think I could be a good police officer, but everybody hates police officers. Why would I want to go do something where everybody's gonna hate me?",
        "Rosa: Yeah, although the one thing I would challenge there, going back to what I said  about 75 or 80% of what police officers do has nothing to do with crime. Most 911 calls do not require an armed, uniformed agent of the state to show up at the door and very often we get into these conversations, oh, crime is up we need more police officers, or too many 911 calls are coming. We need more police officers. It's not actually particularly clear to me that we need more police officers. Maybe we need fewer police officers trained differently, doing different things and more people who are not armed police officers, who are trained differently, who can respond to many, not all, but to many of the kinds of calls that come in.",
        "Rosa: Yeah. ",
        "Rosa: Yeah. Honestly, I didn't watch those videos. It just felt so voyeuristic to watch the  videos, uh, like, it's like a snuff film. And I do think that's become a little bit of an issue in this country, that there's a sort of ritualistic watching of these videos. And it's very difficult because on the one hand, you can't turn away from these things because we wanna change them.But on the other hand, if we sort of start, you know, kind of wallowing in these depictions of pain, particularly black pain. You know, I think that that has some problems too, right? It's really hard. It feels sort of morally wrong both ways, right? It feels morally wrong not to watch it. It also feels morally wrong to watch it.The Tyre Nichols killing. Um, I think there's another piece of this, well, two other pieces of this that I would pull out. One is that people have lots of like, well, how you know these were black officers, why would they do this thing? You know, police culture's very powerful. And police of whatever, race, gender, et cetera, very often their identities, police can start feeling more powerful to them than their identity, whether it's racial or ethnic or religious, or gender, whatever it might be.And the studies on diversification of police departments, they do suggest that police departments that mirror the populations more racially, et cetera, have higher degrees of public satisfaction, but they do not suggest that they have lower levels of lethal force necessarily. And I think part of the reason for that is that people forget that it's not just about racism.There's also a pretty heavy dollop of classism in there of, hey, we middle class people, regardless of race, here are these people who we've discounted as people. They're they're poor, they're quote unquote trash. And that dynamic is powerful in many police departments is one piece of it. The other piece though, which has nothing to do with race as such, goes back to what I said earlier about police getting cynical and they spend all day, every day seeing the worst of people. They much like many in the communities in which they operate, they're often severely traumatized. The rates of PTSD usually undiagnosed among cops, are extraordinarily high. More cops die by suicide every year than of every other cause combined. And the research is crystal clear, not just for police, but across every occupation. Traumatized people often lash out in really terrible ways. You know, they, they beat up their wife or their kid, they drive too fast.They pick fights at bars. And I think that that's a piece of this too. I mean, I don't know enough about these particular officers, but I do think that unacknowledged trauma can make people cruel. It can make people lash out. ",
        "Rosa: Uh, you know, depends what you mean by work, right. ",
        "Rosa: I mean, in a very temporary way, yes, they can. If by work we mean, have you  arrested a lot of people and temporarily reduced like gun? Usually they're targeting things like gun crime, but in a sort of longer term way. Usually what tends to happen is that the people who are participating in gun crimes just move to a different neighborhood, you know, and they.You've got these units kind of chasing people around the city, but also in the longer term, I think they, you know, again, not always, and I, I, I think different police departments structure units like this different ways from one another, but what they can end up doing when they go bad is they actually engender so much community hostility because for every guy who they stop and frisk, who's got illegal weapons, who they arrest, they're stopping a hundred people who are just going about their business and, okay, good news, you got one possibly dangerous guy off the street and you've got a hundred people who don't trust you anymore and who dislike you and who are now less likely to tell you anything and less likely to help you solve any crimes or prevent any crimes.And you know, one of the many of dirty little secrets of policing is that police aren't very good at preventing or solving most crimes. The homicide clearance rates in many cities hover somewhere between 75% and 25% depending on the place. Lots and lots of homicides go unsolved. Burglaries Carjackings even more likely to go unsolved unless the perpetrator is sort of running away as the police get on the scene or as someone known to the victim.It's can be extraordinarily hard for police to do anything, and preventing crime has also just been tremendously difficult, and made more so by community mistrust. If community members are scared of you and don't like you, they're not gonna go to you and say, Hey, I'm really worried about the kid downstairs.I saw him boasting to his friends about how many guns and carjackings they, you know, you're not gonna say that to somebody who you don't trust. And needless to say, even if you trust the police, if you think that the American penal system and criminal justice system writ large is going to mishandle things and it will.Our criminal justice system actually makes the people who have contact with it more likely to commit new crimes rather than less likely. Even if you like the police, you may be very wary of turning somebody over to that system, which may make things worse.music After one last short break, I’ll ask Rosa what she thinks about the movement to defund or even abolish the police.MIDROLL 2Music",
        "Rosa: Yeah. ",
        "Rosa: Different police. Not necessarily no police. ",
        "Rosa: Yeah. I think to me the issue comes down to the sort of defund. I'm not an  abolitionist. I think we're always going to need some people who can use coercion on behalf of the state, but I'm sympathetic to the underlying logic of the defund movement, but I think there's sort of a short term and there's a long term. Long term when you think about, well, what, what would we like community safety to look like in 50 years say?I would like there to be fewer police, doing fewer things. I would like us to have fewer police who are reserved for the really serious violent situations where nothing else is gonna work, and I would like us to have cadres of wonderful social workers, and teachers, and doctors, and you name it, who really are flooding neighborhoods where there's a lot of need and who are responding to that stuff that right now comes to cops that doesn't involve crimes.You know, I'd like to see that, but we don't have that right now, and we're not gonna get to it next year or in two years or in three years. Maybe we could start getting close to it in a decade. Probably not for a generation, because if we want those wonderful social workers to go, well, we're gonna have to train people, we're gonna have to recruit people, we're gonna have to pay people.It's gonna be a hard job. They're gonna need a lot of training. They don't exist right now by and large people sort of blithely talk about, well, couldn't we send a social worker, you know, your average social worker is doing therapy or they're a school counselor, they're not prepared to go into a high crime neighborhood at two in the morning where drunk people are fighting with each other. We just don't have them right now. And we need to be thinking now in every city in the country well, if here's where we wanna be in, in 50 years, if we want to have a really different allocation of public funds and et cetera, et cetera, like what do we do today to make it more likely we're there in 50 years, and then what do we do next year and the year after that?And it's gonna be, even if the political will exists to do it, it's gonna be a long, long process. And there are gonna be mistakes and one of those social workers is gonna get killed, and everybody's gonna start saying, oh, see what a terrible mistake you made.",
        "Rosa: You know, and I would be saying, terrible things do happen. That doesn't mean the  whole idea's a bad idea. And we, we do this all the time. We let the one bad thing sour us on something. I mean, that's exactly what police do, right? They say, well, this happened in this one instance. It must happen all the time, even when it doesn't. ",
        "Rosa: So that's kind of where I come down. ",
        "Rosa: I mean, we Americans are short-term thinkers. We don't have a lot of patience and  that's, I think, one of our national characteristics that's always tripping us up. This is not gonna get better in a couple years, you know, much less a couple months as some cities kind of go, oh, we tried that onto something else. This is gonna take a really long time and we're gonna have to be willing to experiment. We're gonna have to be willing to have failures and learn from them. And I don't know that the American public, much less the people who elect to represent us at various levels have the stomach for that kind of longer term thinking. But it is absolutely the only thing that's gonna get us out of this situation that we're in right now.",
        "Rosa: Yeah. Okay. But I guess I have two reactions, one of which is more agreement with  her, and the other of which is more disagreement. The more disagreement piece is that people are always saying, well, we should listen to people in the affected communities, meaning people of color in particular, but they're not homogeneous either.You know? And in fact, a majority of black Americans, and in particular, a majority of black Americans who live in high crime neighborhoods, they do not want fewer police officers . They want different, better policing, but they don't want fewer. But as I said, there's short term and there's long term, and wouldn't it be nice to get to. No violence, but there's a pretty long in the meantime, if we ever get there, you know, maybe we can kind of get ever closer. But I agree with you. I don't think we're ever gonna get there. I agree with her that I don't think that means we shouldn't try.You know, of course we should be trying. We should be trying to eradicate violence with recognition, the awareness all the time. We probably won't succeed, but that maybe we can reduce it and reduce it and reduce it and reduce it to a level that is less crippling societally. But I think that as long as there is violence, we can't also ignore the fact that it is poor people of color who are also the victims of the vast majority of violent crimes in this country. And it's not good enough to sort of say to them, good news, everybody. We've decided that the real problem is police, so we're not gonna have any police anymore. Well, believing that structural racism exists, you can believe that and still believe that there are people right this minute who, if there are no police, will commit more crimes and will hurt more people.And that doesn't mean were there no structural inequalities, et cetera. Would they have turned out that way? Maybe not. You know, but we're where we are right now, and we can't just wish it away. I do think that the abolitionist terminology and the defund terminology have not done any favors for those movements because I, I think that when you frame it differently, when you frame it as one that is more inclusive to invite police officers to actually be part of the conversation. You end up with a much better, more constructive conversation when you frame it as, Hey, we all share a goal of making the society less violent and less racist, et cetera. That's our goal. We all share that goal. We all think that it doesn't really make sense for police to be mediating arguments between a teenage kid and their parent.Somebody with a gun there may make things worse rather than better. We all can agree on that. And now let's talk nitty gritty. Let's talk. How do we move forward in a way that relieves police officers of tasks that they generally do not wanna be doing? Don't feel well-equipped for, desperately want some other city agency to step in and do instead of them. They're actually gonna be, in many cases, allies. We run a program here at Georgetown. It's a fellowship program with young DC police officers, and we had a session last week. We had a workshop where this was exactly the issue, and the officers were expressing incredible frustration about the fact that they encounter over and over and over again situations where they want to refer people to social services, you know, to counseling, to safe places if they're victims of domestic violence, whatever it may be. And they're like, we call the Department of Behavioral Health and nobody answers the phone ever. So I actually think that you start asking police to be part of that conversation. They become some of the biggest advocates for funding all those other things.",
        "Rosa: Yeah. I mean, I think in an ideal world we would have older cops for one thing. Right  now there's this recruiting crisis. Police departments can't be very picky. But you know, the United Nations, this is decade or more ago, raised the minimum age for UN peacekeeping soldiers to 25, and that's because they found that the vast majority of situations that involved abusive behavior by soldiers involve very young soldiers.And that you raise the age of 25 people start aging out of being jerks. You know, they really. And that if you can restrict it to somewhat older soldiers, that you're gonna have far fewer problems. Not none, but fewer. You know, in an ideal world, I think we would see being a police officer, something that is not your first job out of high school.You know, something that you have to get to after lived experience, and lots and lots of training, recruiting people for their problem solving skills, for their critical thinking, for their communication skills, and every police chief in the country will tell you that that's what they want. We'll say, this is what we need.This is actually not like the military where you're gonna be out there with 50 other people and a command structure and somebody can tell you what to do. Our police officers are out there all by themselves, and yes, they can call their sergeant or they can call for backup. But there's probably gonna be a significant period of time in any situation where it's gonna be one or two officers alone having to decide how to handle a situation.And that really means that you want people who have really good judgment or really good communicators, et cetera, because they're gonna have to make decisions for themselves, which in turn of course, means that you need not only to recruit people with those skills and characteristics in mind, but have training that really reinforces those.I mean, I had a conversation with, uh, a senior official in the DC police department who was saying that he felt like one of the things a lot of the new recruits at the police Academy lacked, it wasn't just, they didn't have deescalation skills, they just did know how to talk to people. And he attributed a little bit to generational stuff of people who have got their heads in their phones.They don't have the face-to-face interactions. And he was saying, They're really trying to think of ways to literally force those recruits to go talk to people. Like your assignment for the next two hours is to have conversations with 10 people to walk around the street, you know, have conversations with people, just say hi and to just practice that.And it sounds so dumb, right? It sounds like, well, everybody knows how to talk, right? And that's sort of an undervalued skill, but a tremendous amount of policing is learning how to say, okay. Wow. Boy, you know, I can see you're pretty upset. I'd be upset too. Well, okay. Well this, you know what's going on here? Huh?Okay. Well maybe we can solve this problem.",
        "Rosa: You know, one of the things I also hear a lot of my friends who are still police officers  saying is this frustration. police departments like everybody else in the universe, they value what they can measure. And you can measure things like arrests. It's very hard to measure situations that were diffused that could have gone wrong.You know, it's the dog that doesn't bark in the night, right? And so they say, You go on YouTube and it's nothing but these terrible videos of police doing awful things. And you know, they, they've sort of naive. They're often sort of like, why aren't there videos of police doing good things ? Because we do good things all the time and they're not wrong, but.Nobody bothers to put on YouTube or is even recording in the first place. You know the interaction that goes really well, the interaction that's pleasant or the interaction where the police officer successfully diffuses a really tense situation and everybody goes away and it's resolved and it's not even forget the general public seeing those videos, right?Police express frustration that their sergeants don't see it either, and nobody. Is tracking or knows how to track who deescalated the most situations. And it's not that the cops don't know, right? They absolutely know. Institutionally it's not rewarded in part because it's hard to quantify, and that's part of the dilemma.",
        "Rosa: I do. I really do. And yeah, that's the thing that really gives me hope. We're now in  our fourth cohort of fellows. So all told, I think we've, maybe… we've had about 70 officers go through this and they're great. And they're super thoughtful. You know, they're super self-aware. They really want to grapple with all of these issues.And I feel like that's part of what we hope will be a generational change in policing, at least in this city, that those young officers will rise in the ranks, and they will, we hope, you know, seed new ideas throughout the department and we really emphasize a big part of the program is talking to them about, what does it mean to be a change agent within an organization? You know, how do you do that when you're in a rigid, hierarchical organization? And I can think of multiple examples of things that have come out of the discussions we've had in those workshops or things that have been part of projects that our fellows have done that have turned into policy for the department.Whether it's new policies for police interactions with adolescents, or whether it's better training on officer wellness, or whether it’s some changes to police academy curriculum. You know, no single one of them is remotely transformative. But going back to the kind of harm reduction concept, no question in my mind: these young officers who've gone through this program have done really concrete things that have made the department a little bit better.And it doesn't solve racism. It doesn't solve poverty. It doesn't solve violence and crime, but it makes life a little better for some, you know, for at least a few people, and it probably saves a few lives and, and that's not chopped liver.",

        "Justin: But no, I do think we are currently in a, you know how like Star Wars movies  sometimes form this arc and people generally recognize that the second movie, the middle movie is the dark one. I think we're in the sort of, Backlash to optimism, finally getting a kind of full swing to it.I think sort of bullishness about pop music is still the dominant mode, certainly for like mainstream media, right? But I do think that there's a lot of traction for a kind of anti-pop sentiment at the moment for sure. ",
        "Justin: Well, I don't know, do I? I don't know that I necessarily agree with that. It used to be  a signal that you were cool for not liking a popular thing. I don't know. I think maybe what I'd say is that people used to look at haters in a more ambivalent or neutral way. Like, one thing I think about a lot is sort of on the old Chappelle show, they, they had the, the bit about the player haters ball, right?And it's sort of making fun of these guys who all dress like, they're all sort of seventies blacksploitation characters and they make a sport right of insulting each other. It's just like, who can craft the best insult? Who can be the most consistently negative about everything? opportunity to hate on a diverse array of mark-ass marks… the most diabolical haters this side of the Mississippi…the difference between then when you could air a sketch like that and there's this sense of like, oh, haters, you know, we all have haters in our lives. Haters are fine. I think now the hater is somebody that is in. Sort of like the nadir of their regard, right? They're sort of seen as like the antagonist of anybody who likes Game of Thrones and Star Wars and Disney, and it's just these haters don't want you to have anything, right?That's the shift, I guess.",
        "Justin: What's funny, when I got into music writing, I can think of rappers that I've  interviewed, but I think rap is different because I think so much of hip hop culture. Or is kind of inherently antagonistic where it's almost inherently like what I was describing about the player haters ball, right. Kind of the dynamic of just living and being a major player in hip hop culture is there are people trying to give you a hard time and it almost actually is a sport dealing with haters in hip hop.That's kind of the joy of a lot of rap records going back to the eighties. Right. Is this sense of you being. The underdog, even once you've become the most popular rapper in the genre or maybe even on earth, right? That's just what hip hop is. The thing you're describing is this fans versus haters dynamic in a more atomic sense, I first encountered on YouTube, right?Like YouTubers were the first people, I remember just constantly kind of talking in this gossip level, haters versus fans way. Phenomenon you're identifying, right? A video could have a thousand comments on it, but for whatever reason, one negative comment got under the YouTuber's skin and then they made a follow up video in response to that.It's not like human nature has changed or anything. We understand why the YouTuber reacts to that negative comment that way. But there is something about the fact, and we're, we're writers and we live on the internet in a sense, right? So it's a sense of. Being on the internet, you kind of have to manage a personal brand in a way like your, your, your own PR department, and that's why you end up internalizing stuff like that so much more than you might have if you were, I don't know, a Vanity Fair journalist in 1993.",
        "Justin: Yeah. ",
        "Justin: Yeah. ",
        "Justin: Well, I don't, I don't know. I mean, I think in the beginning that kind of spread  positivity, defense mechanism is understandable, right? Once you realize that you're living in a version of the internet where one, you just sort of there constantly. Yeah, you have a schedule for releasing videos or uploading tik toks or whatever.you're just always there. So you gotta find a way to warp reality in such a way, , like you have a kind of rationalization of everything that you're doing, and you don't have to sort of internalize negative feedback because you just feel like you're being poisoned after a point if you just making YouTube all day.But I really don't think that you can talk YouTubers or others out of this posture yet. And I don't, I don't, I don't know how close we are to that. Right. I, I think that's still the default tone, the default survival mechanism of someone who has to live on the internet with a huge following, where they have to filter out a lot of negative feedback.",
        "Justin: I think, I think about a lot. The thing you're saying with, um, you know, what  happens when your website gives Taylor Swift album a seven, right? And that that's not enough for people. You know, some people think that in review websites of all kinds of all media in the past 20 years. Right. It's almost like a grade inflation has happened as a result of this fan pressure because it's sort of, whether you're talking about a video game or whether you're talking about a Taylor Swift album, anything lower than a seven scans as a pan to peopleRight. And you're right. I think in that sense, you're right. There's never been a worst time to be a critic. It's one thing when you do genuinely pan an album and you're like, yeah, I wrote that. Knowing. This artist has fans and they're gonna be mad and they're gonna disagree with things that I said. But I think the definitive dynamic of our time is you can write something positive, but just insufficiently positive and people will, will snap on you,That's the dynamic. That's the modern dynamic.",
        "Justin: I've been there ",
        "Justin: No, I've been ca I mean I'm uncancelable, but you know what I mean, right? Like it's  sort of just as somebody whose like main music criticism, background is rap, there was definitely a specific period of a climate of fear around Nikki. It's also like, I haven't been on Twitter for years. It's so sort of like without a Twitter account,",
        "Justin: you know, I have fine, but like back then, right. If you, you know what I mean? If they could touch you, they could touch you, right? I don't know. It's almost like there's this balance, right? There's a, there's, in any, any year, any decade, there's a certain amount of fan energy in a culture and a certain amount of hater energy in a culture. And the, the balance of these things shifts.And right now we're just sort of, you know, I, I think the past 10 years have been this. High point of the saturation of fan energy and low point of the saturation of hater energy, and it's almost like the fan contingent in culture know that they have this upper hand and they're really reveling in it.",
        "Justin: Yeah. And people, I think often treat those responses as mutually exclusive. Right?  Like the, the thing that's frustrating about the person who's mad about either somebody is like, I liked endgame, but I didn't like the specific thing. Or frankly, even the person who's like, I didn't like endgame and I don't like the M C U, is that the fan in this scenario?Internalizes, this idea that they're being talked over or that they're being invalidated or obliterated in some way when that moment happens. And I think that's the real problem that's emerged in the current fan hater dynamic. People really struggle with this idea that, Hey, someone saying somewhere on the internet that they don't like something literally doesn't have to have any impact on you whatsoever if you don't want it to.So what's the issue right? ",
        "Justin: But can, can I make a concession or, or ask what you think about a sort of  counterpoint I’ll offer here, which is that, so if we're talking about the famous comic with the panel, let people enjoy things. One thing I sometimes think as somebody who's been a hater my whole life is that, okay, those fans, right?Those fans who overhear somebody being negative about something, somebody having a critical opinion about something and internalizing that, right? They have to be reacting to something. Something makes me think that at some other point, those people who maybe are really invested in Batman comics or Star Wars or something like that, maybe earlier in their lives or at a different point in the balance between fan culture and hater culture, they felt like there was actually somebody holding the finger of their mouth or they felt that their subculture was being held down in some way. It feels like maybe there's a bit of that at play where maybe that if haters are being honest with themselves, there was a point in the history of these fan hater relations where haters did have more of an upper hand against fans, and fans didn't like how haters treated them.Is there something to that idea?",
        "Justin: Yeah, I think absolutely. I do think. Critics have a, like, again, this is sort of a  manifestation of the problem of how are critics supposed to do their job when there is this, this kind of, it feels like it's a little more than soft pressure . I mean, I, the easy response is to say, well, the New York Review of books, or The New York Times, or New York maga, wherever, or the ringer.Worry about that or shouldn't care about it or should, should try to keep a level head and keep things in perspective whenever Nicki stans, get riled up. about a 6.7 review of a Nicki Minaj album, right? And ideally that would be what happens. But even setting aside how maybe the executive editor of your website responds to that and sort of counsels you as a writer at that website when it's happening, the truth is if you are a writer, that's just not an enjoyable experience to go through either, right? So even if the publication will have your back, it still feels bad to write something thoughtful but critical about someone or something on the internet. and to people to just kinda harass you about it for days, weeks, months, maybe even years, right?Like I've seen that play out in the past decade with people where it's like people will write some infamous pan of something and it's just that there's clearly a kind of fan who like Chave, , like miserable will like hunt this critic to the ends of the earth for the rest of their life. It's the social media part, right?It's the part where that critic feels like, okay, well, I have to be a brand. I have to attend to a brand. I have to be on the internet. I can't just not have a Twitter account, not have X, Y, and Z ways that people can sort of get in my dms and my mentions. You kind of want to say, well, this is part of the territory of being a writer.And to an extent it is, but it's also just unpleasant when it reaches a certain level, right? It just sucks.",
        "Justin: Yeah. You know what's funny too about this is that I, I may be articulating some of  this as, oh, this is a fact of the internet and how the internet is transformed. But the truth is, I remember the internet, of let's say the late two thousands, early 2010s. That's an internet where it's sort of, Twitter's been around for a bit.Facebook's been around for a bit. Social media has been around for a bit. , and yet it still felt like in that window you could still do writing where you're disagreeing. You maybe even just writing the kind of blog post where it's like you're responding directly to another blogger, right? Something like that.Right. You're writing a pan, you're writing all kinds of critical writing. You're even sometimes being super explicitly just spicy. Right? People used to be spicy in the blog era.",
        "Justin: And yet it was still sort of understood that you could have an argument with  whoever on the internet. Either an artist that you're reviewing album of maybe another writer, and at the end of the day, the point is that, well, these are writers.They're doing the things writers do. They're hashing out ideas. They're having disagreements about stuff, and they're adults though, so they should be able to walk it off and we can all understand that this is just this is intellectual life. This is intellectual work. And I think the thing that's changed, right?The thing that makes it feel like bad for criticism is the part where people, people don't just walk off disagreement now, right? People do the thing where they will camp your mentions for the rest of your life. If you cross the wrong line, they will engage you in screenshot warfare till the ends of the earth.",
        "Justin: Yeah, this, you, they will, this you like four years after the fact of something they're  gonna, this you, you, you know, on Twitter, there's been a fundamental breakdown in people's ability to process disagreement and just accept that it's natural to disagree. If anything like. If you're the kind of person who's sitting on Twitter all day in the first place and reading articles, it's because you like being intellectually stimulated and you take as a fact that you're gonna encounter a lot of headlines and even whole articles if you actually read them that you're gonna disagree with.But that's part of what you enjoy, that's lost the time. And now you have people who are mad and they don't even know why, and they forgot that the whole point of reading other people's thoughts and ideas is to encounter other people's thoughts and ideas. And so instead they get mad. when they encounter content that is not just sort of reflecting their own mindset and biases and priorities back at them, and it's just incredibly strange.If you remember what the internet and internet writing was like before 2015.",
        "Justin: I think on the one hand it's that, right? It's the way that people kind of find social  justice angles into stories that are not realistically. If like at the level of a genuine political emergency, you know what I think about the speaking of 2010s blogging, right? Like I think about the boom of the first person essay.",
        "Justin: One thing that kind of bugged me, and again, remember, I'm a lifelong hater, so  everything bugs me, but one thing that always bugged me about it is about personal essays and how they would sort of be written, not just to be a kind of memoir style writing, but to be a kind of way in to maybe an intellectual debate.Is that like there are definitely strengths to coming at things from a first person perspective, but one thing that the first person essay did in the 2010s is it made it hard to disagree with people about stuff, right? Because it's one thing if somebody. Some detached, maybe voicey, but still third person essay, and you disagree with ideas in it, and you're just like, well, I disagreed X, Y, and Z.But once you revert to first person, You sort of in this weird territory of like, am I gonna contradict this person's lived experience? Like are they, if I contradict or dispute something in this essay, they're gonna internalize that. Right? That sort of trend line in the 2010s is sort of hand in hand with what you're saying about how the moment you decide that disagreeing about which film won best Oscar in 2019 isn't just a question of taste, but it's also about the future of race relations in the United States. You've escalated this potential disagreement up to 11, and it's sort of like one by doing that, right, you've made it harder for people to even want to do it,",
        "Justin: the people who do want to throw down about it are gonna be people who are  already at 11, right?And are gonna wanna , you know.",
        "Justin: Like that ends up being, the problem with it is that you really screen out a lot of  more sort of, I think, nuanced conversation with a lot of how these dynamics have taken shape over the past 10 years or so.music We’ll be back with more of my conversation with Justin Charity… after a quick break.MIDROLL 1Music",
        "Justin: That's, that's, it's honestly refreshing. ",
        "Justin: But but part of it too, right? It's sort of okay leaning into being a hater, right? Like  trying to be a part of the counter reaction against positivity culture. It's like, I feel like what we're really ultimately talking about is at some point, some sizable contingent of the internet decided that almost all disagreement is catastrophic.Almost all dissent is catastrophic. And being a hater kind of in the attitude of the person you just described is not about saying the fan outlook on culture is wrong, and the hater outlook is right. To me, it's more about a mindset of like, I'm a hater. It's fine. Like this doesn't have to be a catastrophe.Like it's also fine that you are a fan and sometimes it can be interesting and fun when fans and haters come into interactions with each other and trade ideas and leave different impressions on third party observers who maybe don't identify as fans or haters, but maybe you learn from watching the interaction of a fan object and criticism of that object. ",
        "Justin: What I was describing earlier about how even if you're a professional writer and you  pan something and your editor has your back, but it sucks if you get brigade bandwagon and do oblivion by a Stan Army. That environment makes it hard to develop the thick skin necessary to just be like, well, whatever, I'm a hater. If that's such a bad word, then whatever. I just identify as it. It's harder to do, I feel like than ever before. It has to be that this is the hardest time to ever develop that thick skin because you're just so overexposed to the backlash to things. But, You kind of just have to do it. Like even if Twitter didn't exist, even if Facebook, TikTok didn't exist, like you would wanna be a careful writer who speaks with precision and clarity.But it's a genuinely awful feeling when you catch yourself saying not, oh, I want to tweet. I'm saying this because it's maybe not true, or It's not quite how I feel. And instead, you realize that the voice in your head isn't even in your own voice. It's like the voice of a disembodied tweet yelling at you or something.",
        "Justin: It's humiliating to catch yourself sort of thinking that and sort of realizing that, oh  wow, my writing really is being in some way puppeteered by a backlash that doesn't even exist yet. Right. You don't want that. No one wants that, I don't think, and writing can't live if it's gonna be in an environment where writers are constantly thinking that, you know?",
        "Justin: Yeah. ",
        "Justin: Yeah. And it's like the, the less likely to engage part is so important to me because  what that means is that people encounter a headline, right? Or they encounter an excerpt of something and they think they already know, right? They think they already know what you said in 2000 words because they read eight words and they've kind of pantomime you into existence, right.As either a fan of something or a hater of something, or a liberal or conservative or whatever. Like people just sort of carry these straw men in their pockets. Right? And I think that's kind of the other unpleasant thing. It's also behind why if you see a score that's too low on a review, you just assume right as the Taylor stan that, oh, this writer is disrespecting Taylor. They, they, they hate ta. Why couldn't they get somebody who likes the artist? And then meanwhile, the reviewer is someone who loves Taylor Swift",
        "Justin: Or they love Lana Del Rey though, right? They love Kendrick Lamar, and they're  trying to articulate a hard thought or a series of hard thoughts in their review, but you've just dismissed it out of hand because it doesn't say 10 10.This is the greatest album since sliced bread, right? Like this is so much middle ground between being an archetypal hater and an archetypal fan, right? And I don't know how much of that is reversible. That's what I wonder…",
        "Justin: I don't know that there's a specific way you could change Twitter or TikTok that  would disincentivize the bad things and incentivize the good things.",
        "Justin: I feel like that's an artifact of the thing you said at the very top of the discussion,  right, which is, this is what happens when, you devolve the idea of celebrity all the way down to guy making short form videos with no producer in his mom's basement. You know what I mean? And so it what it's like everybody internalizes the idea that anybody with more than a thousand followers anywhere is interchangeable with Beyonce, or interchangeable with like George Bush in terms of their stature.That's the issue a little bit.",

Although I do wanna make one caveat now cause I think you've  clarified something. when these people do kind of brig or kind of, you know, proactive mischaracterization of things they encounter on the internet, like, I don't claim those people, right? Like those people aren't being haters. ",
        "Justin: It's tempting to conflate the idea of being a hater with being a person who's like  angry about stuff.They, they're not really similar modes at all. Right.

        "Justin: and it might even rant about it. Right. But it's still different. I've been a hater in  capacities where I've just been like, I cannot stop talking about how much I dislike this thing, but it's still different from being like, I don't like this thing versus I don't like this thing, and now I'm going to harass the creator of it forever.That's the difference.",
        "Justin: I absolutely do. Especially going back to what I was saying in the beginning about  how. Coming at it, for instance, from a hip hop perspective, I think definitely a lot of the, the kind of encoded antagonism, right? That that emergent artists or really artists at every phase of their career have to deal with from gatekeepers, from fans, right?That sense of steel, sharpen steel and hip hop culture, right? I don't think people would give rappers in that culture such a hard time if they didn't love hip hop and if they didn't feel defensive of hip hop on some level. Right? Like the people you'll find who will get the, the angriest and Aggies and kind of the most.Hater about hip hop are people who love hip hop and who you would never mistake for people who actually secretly don't like hip hop or tuned out of it. Right? So it's absolutely, I think the case that like the, the primary motivation of a hater is in fact love and a defensiveness and a desire to see a thing be, at least in the hater's estimation, the best version of itself.",

And then that's when it becomes weird cuz you don't have the thing where it's like, well you like hip hop in general and you happen to listen to this bad thing because it's one of many albums. You instead, it's like you only listen to this thing or read this byline because you hate this person, but you're weirdly like one of their biggest fan.That's a kind of hating, that is a, that's a kind of hating and that's not my style of hating.

        "Justin: No, I definitely think people should worry because it, I do think it's possible to  unlearn, or at least partially unlearn that, hey, the culture of putting ideas into the world and refining them and exchanging 'em with other writers, especially in the age of internet, where you can do it instead of real time or near real time, like, Yeah, I mean we are watching people forget that the point of that is not to play act a sort of real life war , right?That the idea is that you are actually interested in seeing how ideas play out. Together. I don't know. I think there is a real danger of that muscle sort of atrophying, right? Because people just don't use it for too long. And I definitely think that insofar as we're talking about sine waves or ebbs and flows in culture, I at least have hope that people will sort of come around to the idea that the.Turned up to 11 style of online discourse is like played out a little bit that it's not really serving anyone well and it mostly just makes people feel anxious and bad if they spend a lot of time on the internet. Like I definitely expect people are learning will learn that lesson. But, because I can't even imagine sort of what platforms will emerge and what they'll look like, that sort of reimpose or reconstitute the alternative culture of disagreement as something that we can all just live with and in fact accept as the whole fact and point of interacting with strangers on the internet.Like I do worry about that cause I just don't know what it looks like.

        "Justin: No. And so like I'm at The Ringer and I feel like I at the Ringer have carved out this  space, right? Both on the The Ringer website and also on my podcast Sound only. Which I do with, um, Micah Peters. I touch a lot of different things. I touch hip hop or like anime or video games, and it sort of, it, it, it makes sense.My byline makes sense to me if to no one else, right? But when I left Twitter, you remember the first wave of fake pieces people would write of like, . I quit Twitter for a month and this is what I found . Right. And I always felt like the premise of pieces like that were always misguided. They always sort of assumed that like, oh, Twitter sucks because you're exposed to all this stuff and it's this overload of information and you get mad at other people.And it's like, I think I had this realization at the time of like, oh, that's the trick. Everybody thinks that the problem with social media is other people. The problem with social media is you. Because the issue is like Twitter is actually a perfectly fine website. If it's a website that you can go see a feed.You know, see what somebody's saying about something. The thing that makes Twitter bad is your own timeline, right? It's the, it's the fact that you have the power to post individually, right? Like no one's problem on Twitter is other people. Everyone's problem is themselves and their capacity to post and to create the thing that becomes their timeline, right?And so to me, I didn't have any high-minded reason. I just realized that the problem isn't other people being mad that you didn't like a Drake album. Right? The problem is that you've internalized that so deeply in yourself that that matters. I think once I left Twitter and then I left all, I deleted Facebook. I deleted like all my social media at the time, and ever since I did that, I. I haven't felt perfectly. I still think that there's a lot of sort of stuff about the current sort of web writing that still makes for a bad culture overall.But I don't know, I think at least deleting my own capacity to post and instead having to think in terms of, look, whatever thoughts, feelings, anxieties I have, I gotta work them in my byline itself, or I mean offline, right? I just talk to my wife about stuff. But it's sort of, if it's germane to the internet, it's germane to the conversation about an artist.I gotta put it in the piece. It's like, oh yeah, that's why Twitter's bad. It's cuz like you end up sort of spilling yourself all over this platform that doesn't pay you. Twitter is like a glorified. internship, it's a glorified unpaid internship, right? Like so many, so many people who've gotten into journalism in the past decade, like they've had to basically spill themselves, not just in the capacity of what it is that they cover, but they've just had to kind of sell their entire personal life to a website that does not compensate them in any way.It doesn't guarantee anything about their career, and I think that's one small step you can make that kind of like reduce, but you can't tell that to a YouTuber, right? Because the YouTuber's like, no, they're not like someone who's like, well, I have a byline, and then Twitter is secondary. It's",

        "Justin: I loved it too. This was great. ",
        "Holden: Uh, way on the high end of that scale. I don't know. We, we live in a crazy world. I don't  know if I want to quite give it a 10, but I, I wasn't expecting it.",
        "Holden: I had met SBF I would say a handful of times. He was entering into a space that  overlapped a lot with our space. So basically what happened was SBF was becoming the funder of a foundation that was funding some of the same causes and some of the same organizations we were. And that creates kind of a natural need to communicate a bit sometimes just say, Hey, we might both be interested in this grant.Things like that. And so we did have periodic meetings by video chat. I met him a couple times at effective altruist events. We certainly weren't friends. It was a professional relationship with occasional conversations.",
        "Holden: My impression of a lot of people is agnostic. I really do try to reserve judgment. I think  interviews are not very reliable signals of someone's character. It's hard to get a real grip on what someone's all about from talking to them. You have to see what they do. Yeah, I don't, I don't think I had a really strong read.I mean, I do think there were signs of things to be concerned about with respect to SBF and FTX. He ran this Alameda research company and there were a number of people who had worked there who left kind of very upset with how things had gone down. And I did hear from some of them what had gone wrong and, from their perspective, what they were unhappy about.And I did hear about things that really concerned me. Also just crypto, I think I've never been a crypto expert, but when I saw some of the advertisements for FTX, talking about crypto being very good for the world, or the Super Bowl ad, kind of saying, Hey, don't miss out on the next big thing. These are things in hindsight, I kind of wish had registered with me more.But I, I'm not, I'm not gonna, you know, there were signs, there were things that made me nervous. There were things that made me say, okay, I don't really know what the deal is with FTX. I don't really know what the deal is with SBF, I certainly see some reasons that one could be concerned, that one could imagine just like low integrity behavior, less than honest and scrupulous behavior.Behavior I'm not comfortable with at the same time. I just don't think that I knew anything that rose to the level of expecting what happened to happen or really being in a position to go around denouncing them or something. Honestly, they weren't someone who I thought of it as my job to vet or to have a really firm view on.Um, now it feels a little bit different in hindsight, but it felt at the time, like he was a very famous person going around talking about effective altruism and associating himself with effective altruism. And it didn't really seem like there was much I could do in either direction about that.Some of that does feel regrettable in hindsight.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I, I did have a bit of a different path. Uh, my basic story is I, outta college, I  worked for a few years in finance, worked at a hedge fund, worked at a couple hedge funds actually, and well, I wanted to give to charity and a bunch of my friends did as well. And we were having conversations and just talking about how we could sort of, in some sense get the best deal on giving to charity, help the most people for the least money.This is a huge question. This is a lot of work. We're really interested in it. We're much more interested in this than we are in the bond market and we don't think we can do justice to this question part-time. So we quit our finance jobs, we raised money from our former coworkers, and we started GiveWell in 2007.And no one was using the term effective altruism for years after that so GiveWell was just trying to solve a practical problem. And in 2012, I think it was, we met Cari Tuna and Dustin Moskovitz. Dustin is co-founder of Facebook and Asana, and they were looking to give away their personal fortune of billions of dollars and they were asking a similar question, Hey, how can we give this away and help people as much as possible with it?Do the best thing with. And we said, Hey, we're really interested in this question too. But we felt that GiveWell was not the perfect thing for them because GiveWell was really aimed at the kind of person we were. It's like, Hey, I wanna give a few thousand dollars and have a few hours to think about it.And Cari and Dustin are giving away, like, billions of dollars and had decades to think about it. We felt we needed a different kind of organization and workflow to get them the best recommendations. So we started Open Philanthropy originally as a project within GiveWell called GiveWell Labs, and then it spun out. And Open Philanthropy did go in a bit of a different direction and pursued this philosophy of hits-based giving, which is this idea that you might try 10 different wacky things with your giving, and nine of them might go embarrassingly badly, and one of them might go amazingly well and make up for everything else.And so we thought that was an interesting philosophy of giving to try out with Cari and Dustin, kind of researched the history of philanthropy and I felt surprised by how big some of the successes were, just in terms of the impact on issues like global poverty, feminism, and so that was kind of my trajectory.And as the person running Open Philanthropy, I just became more and more professionally interested in this question of how do you do an outsized amount of good with money or with time? What are issues that are not only important but neglected? Intractable? So that you can get really far? I mean, I don't believe I was involved in, like, coming up with the term effective altruism.It was these folks in Oxford who kind of came out with this brand and this name, and that was around 2013. So it's like we were kind of transitioning from GiveWell to Open Philanthropy at that point. And I had met a bunch of these people and thought they were interesting people to talk to. We definitely shared a lot of goals. And so when I learned about effective altruism, I said, Hey, doing the most good possible, helping people as much as you can, that's great.That's something I'm interested in. I'm really interested in this. Yeah, there've always been things about effective altruism, the community and the brand and the idea that I've been less than comfortable with, but also, no one's perfect, no community's perfect. And I looked at this idea in this community and said, Hey, we, we have an awful lot in common in terms of what we are interested in accomplishing with our lives.And, and that's absolutely still the case.",
        "Holden: Probably a recurring theme that's gonna come up in this conversation is that it’s not  like there's a CEO of effective altruism who decides what is and what isn't, and who is and who isn't. And so any question you ask like that, it's gonna depend who you talk to and who you ask.Right. There's nowhere where I signed up to be an effective altruist. In fact, if someone asked me, you know, are you an effective altruist? Like, I don't always give the same answer. I mean, generally I'd say yes, but sometimes I would say, well, but that doesn't mean I agree with everything that comes out of the effective altruist community.It's kind of a hard question to answer. Certainly it's the case that people who are interested in effective altruism often are reading what I'm writing and very interested in it, and things like that. I mean, that's definitely true.",
        "Holden: So an important thing to lead off with, I'm not a philosopher, I don't have a PhD in  philosophy, and one of the first things I noticed about the differences between me and the folks who are kind of coming up with the effective altruist name is that they were coming from philosophy tradition. A bunch of them were like actual philosophy professors.Now I’ll say, I'm really interested in philosophy. I enjoy it a lot. I've read a bunch of it, I've argued about it a lot, but it's not my area of expertise. So I'd lead off by basically saying utilitarianism is roughly a theory that doing the most good possible, in some sense, taking all the benefit you gave to all the persons in the world – and I use “persons,” ‘cause it's not necessarily humans – if you take all the benefit you did for all the persons in the world and add it up and you do as much good as possible, utilitarianism would be the theory that that is what ethics is. And so therefore, if you are wondering whether you did the right thing, that is the same question as if you did the most good and that, I think — we can get into this — I think that is different from effective altruism and it's actually an idea that I don't personally subscribe to.",
        "Holden: You know, I think the organs example, I do wanna say, I think your average utilitarian  would give a different answer there. I think your average actual utilitarian would say, actually, no, that's not the way to do the most good. That would create a society where people are afraid to come into a hospital, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.So I think these debates can get a lot more nuanced and, and subtle than just, Hey, yeah, utilitarians are into grabbing random people's organs. I mostly don't endorse utilitarianism, but I also don't want to straw person it. So, you asked me could this have motivated SBF, I mean, I think there's a bunch of ideas here that kind of are sitting near each other, but are actually different ideas.So there's utilitarianism, which is the idea that doing the most good is kind of all there is to ethics, or at least that's the very amateur definition I'm giving it. Then there's the ends justify the means, which can mean a few different things, but it might mean that you just kind of believe that you can do arbitrarily defective, deceptive, coercive, nasty things as long as you kind of worked out the numbers and they lead to a lot of good.And then I think effective altruism is neither of those. It's a third thing which we can get to. So I mean, I don't know. I, like, honestly don't know if SBF was motivated by ends justify the means reasoning. I'm really going off of what I'm reading in the media. I don't have special insight and the media on this is confusing.So like, got this weird interview where he says, ethics is all sham, but some people think he's just talking about certain flavors of ethics…",
        "Holden: It certainly looks like the actual ends that he caused to happen didn't justify and don't  justify anything. And I'd be surprised if anyone would disagree with that.It just like doesn't actually look like he did good. It looks like he did harm. So it looks like on utilitarianism or any other ethical system, it wouldn't, I don't think there's a story right here where what he did looks good, but is it possible that he was saying to himself, Hey, I'm taking these giant risks and it's totally worth it because I'm gonna make all this money and do all these great things with it.It is possible that that's what motivated him. And I think that's a problem. I mean, that's something that bothers me. The fact that it's possible alone bothers me.",
        "Holden: I feel like it is a risk and I wrote a piece about this called “EA is about maximization and  maximization is perilous.” And this was back in September or something. So this was well before, any of this stuff came out. And I had no idea it was coming at that time. And, I said in this piece, I said, you know, here's something that makes me nervous.EA is doing the most good. What does that mean? You're maximizing the amount of good, anytime you're maximizing something, that's just, it's perilous. Life is complicated and there's a lot of different dimensions that we care about, and we're often confused about what we ourselves want. So if you take some thing X and you say, to maximize X, you better really hope you have the right X.And in fact, one of the classic concerns about AI risk is that you might have an AI that is trying to maximize something and it's not quite the right thing, and then we get a horrible catastrophe. And then also: maximize what? And I think we're all extremely confused about that. Even the effective altruists who are lifetime philosophy professors, I don't think there's a good, coherent answer to what we are supposed to be maximizing.So I've talked about doing the most good, talked about doing the most good for our dollar. I think these are compelling, interesting ideas. They're vague ideas. They haven't been totally worked out. If you ask GiveWell, hey, what is it exactly that you maximized with my dollar? Was it live saved? Was it people helped?They'll say kind of, well, it's complicated. We have this metric called the disability adjusted life-year. We sort of use that, but we also apply some common sense. It's just kind of hard. So I think that is a dicey situation, and I just feel like you're always skating a little close to the edge.It just feels like a current that we all have to swim against and a constant temptation to have trouble that we all have to deal with. And as far as I can tell today, I feel like we are dealing with it. I feel like when I meet actual effective altruists, they don't seem very ends-justify-the-means-y on the whole, with exceptions, they seem like high integrity people.They seem like people who do believe in many different flavors of morality. They don't seem like the kind of people who think you should take someone's organs, but we gotta watch out. And so I wrote that and then this happened, and then I said, okay, maybe we have to watch out more than I thought we had to watch out.",
        "Holden: I feel like the points being made in that post look, like, pretty right. Um, look like, Hey,  we should be concerned about this. I feel more concerned about this than I did when I wrote the post for sure. Like, I feel like I should have listened to that post more than I did or something.",
        "Holden: Maybe, I mean, it's hard. It's, it's, there's a lot going on at any given time and, and this is something that I've worried about for years. Knowing what I know now, I would've worried about it more. But all the worrying I do has costs because there's many things to worry about. And then there's many things to, to not worry about and to move forward with and do to try and help a lot of people.",
        "Holden: Well, the thing I say in the post is that effective altruism, in my opinion, works best with  a strong dose of moderation and pluralism.",
        "Holden: I dunno, maybe this would be a good time for me to talk about what I see as the  difference between utilitarianism and effective altruism. ",
        "Holden: They both have this idea of doing as much good as you can. Utilitarianism is a theory, it's a philosophical theory, and it says doing the most good – that's the same thing as ethics. Ethics equals doing the most good. So if you did the most good, you were a good person, and if you didn't, you weren't, or something like that. I think that it's something of that flavor.And that's an intellectual view. You can have that view without doing anything. You could be a utilitarian and never give to charity and say, well, I should give to charity, but I just didn't. I'm a utilitarian because I think I should. And so that's utilitarianism. And effective altruism is kind of the flip of what I just said where it says, Hey, doing the most good, that's, I don't know, for lack of a better word: cool. We should do it. You know? We're gonna take actions to help others as effectively as we can. There's no claim that this is ethics. There's no claim that this is all there is to ethics. How I relate to effective altruism is, hey, doing as much good as you can: that's cool. I like it and I want to do it. That does not mean that is the only thing I want to do, the only thing I care about. It does not mean I think it's the same thing as ethics. So there's lots of times when I try to do the right thing and I'm not just calculating what's gonna do the most good. Being a good friend or telling the truth… these are not things where I'm diagramming out, how many utilons is this gonna create? These are things I'm trying to do ‘cause they're right. So this is the distinction, is, for me, effective altruism means: doing the most good. That's great. That's something we're gonna do. We're gonna take actual actions we're gonna give to charity, we're gonna give to the best charities we can, and there's this whole tangle of abstract, philosophical considerations that you do not have to sign on to to do that.Now this is confusing and it's not exactly shocking if a bunch of utilitarians are very interested in effective altruism, and a bunch of effective altruists are very interested in utilitarianism. So, you're gonna get these two things. They're gonna be hanging out in the same place, and you are gonna face this danger.I'm not terribly surprised that some people look at it and say, Hey, that is all I want to do with my life. I think that's a mistake. I think balance is important, but there are people who think that way and those people are gonna be drawn into the effective altruist community. And I get where that's coming from.",
        "Holden: Uh, you know, I definitely think there are people who take EA too far, but I wouldn't say  that EA equals the overcorrection. So I don't know. I mean, I kind of am just sitting here and saying, Look, I don't think utilitarianism, doing the most good is all there is to ethics. I don't consider myself a utilitarian, though, I think it's an interesting framework that has been very thought-provoking for me and that I give some weight. I give weight to a bunch of different ethical theories. You know, I'm not a philosophy professor. I don't think the ends justify the means. I have a lot of stuff I care about in my life other than doing the most good. I do tons of stuff that doesn't do the most good. All this is true and yet no matter how many things people do with cryptocurrency exchanges or something, I don't think it's ever gonna change me from thinking that helping as many people as you can by donating to the most effective charity you can is good and I want to do it. I feel like I don't want to let things get too complicated here and lose sight of that. And what effective altruism means to me is basically that. It’s, hey, let’s help a lot of people, let's be ambitious about helping a lot of people. Let's give to the best charities we can find. Not to whatever charity sent us a solicitation in the mail.And gosh, that just seems really right to me and I really am passionate about it. And I give to charity every year and give to the best charities we can and, I don't know if I'm gonna call that an overcorrection. I feel like this is good.And so, I think I'm more in the camp of this is a good idea in moderation. This is a good idea when accompanied by pluralism. Let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater, is kind of where I'm at.",
        "Holden: I do like to see that. I do want to emphasize, I don't think I'm alone here. I don't think  that everyone who's excited about effective altruism is a full-on utilitarian except for me. I think the attitude I'm describing is actually fairly common, and I think a lot of the people I've met are, are in a similar boat to me.Hey, let's help lots of people. That would be great. Let's cut back on some of the most dangerous issues facing humanity. That would be great. Let's not only donate, let's think about how we're using careers. That would be great, too.I would like to see it. I do like to see it, but yes, I think I would like to see more of it. And it is something I've been thinking about is, is there a way to encourage or to just make a better intellectual case for pluralism and moderation, because I think it's, it's not just something that you get by asking for it.music Is it more important to help struggling people right now, or to protect the long-term future of the human species? For a big philanthropic organization like Holden’s, this is far more than just a theoretical question.I’ll ask him where he comes down on this issue of “longtermism”... after a quick break.MIDROLL 1music ",
        "Holden: I, I wanna draw some more fine-grained distinctions here. ",
        "Holden: Longtermism… yeah, I think has been expressed in a few different ways, but it tends to  emphasize the importance of future generations. Generations other than this one. There's a separate idea of just like, I don't know what to call it, like catastrophic risk reduction.So there's a separate idea that just says, Hey, you know what? There's some risks facing humanity that are really big that we really gotta be paying more attention to. One of 'em is climate change. One of 'em is pandemics. So Covid-19 was obviously an enormous tragedy that was one of the biggest world-changing events you can imagine.I worry that as biotechnology advances and gets cheaper and easier to use, it could get easier for people to design viruses that are worse than Covid-19, that these could be done in a military context and could end up leaking out because I think the biosafety in these programs can be surprisingly terrible.Then there's AI. And I've talked about AI and written about AI quite a bit. I think that the dangers of certain developments, certain kinds of AI that you could easily imagine being developed and we have no idea when they will be, are vastly underappreciated in my view. You could hold the view that AI risk and biorisk are huge issues that we should be paying more attention to without holding the view that we need to be obsessed with future generations.You can also hold the view that we should consider future generations to contain most of the ethical value of the world without agreeing that biorisk and AI risk are the biggest risks to focus on. So, I would say that I'm currently more sold on biorisk and AI risk as, just, things that we've gotta be paying more attention to, no matter what your philosophical orientation. I'm more sold on that than I am on longtermism.But I am somewhat sold on both. I've always kind of thought, hey, future generations matter. Future people are people and we should care about what happens to the future. I mean, that, that just seems like something I've always believed, and I've always been skeptical of claims that go further than that and might say something like, well, the value of future generations, and in particular, the value of as many people as possible getting to exist is so vast that it just completely trumps everything else, and you shouldn't even think about other ways to help people.That's a claim that I've never really been on board with, and I'm still not on board with.",
        "Holden: Basically, yes. I think it, it, it can get a little subtle, I think if I knew for sure exactly what  was going on and I had like perfect knowledge of everything, you know, that might be one thing, but I think in the real world, to go from this philosophical argument to like, therefore, you should be kind of ignoring all these real world problems and focusing entirely on things that might affect the long-term future.Yeah, I don't buy that argument for a number of reasons. If it were not the case that AI risk and biorisk and, and other things like climate change looked like such a potential big deal this century – if it were the case that really all we could do about the long run future were this incredibly speculative stuff, reaching out, you know, billions of years and trying to figure out what's gonna happen then, I think I would just say like, this isn't very productive from a practical point of view.We're not gonna get much done here. It's better to like, do things we can do and maybe learn about the world as we do them. So I think there's a lot of reasons that I wouldn't be into that. I also think that like the rabbit hole goes deeper. So this is a thing that… you can keep going down this road. So you can say, well, you know, if you wanna maximize your expected value, you should really focus on the people in the future.But what about people in other parts of the multiverse? What about people in other parts of an infinite universe who you might be able to affect through your actions being correlated with theirs through various theoretical mechanisms tied to some of these like non-causal decision theories I mentioned. What about the fact that if there's actually infinite people in the universe that all of this stuff is undefined and you can't take an expected value over anything, that there can't really be an ethical basis for doing one thing or another at all? More or less? Unless you take on some other weird assumptions in your ethical system that break a bunch of other stuff and cause a bunch of other problems – I actually could go on like this for, like, quite a long time.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I mean the basic idea of worldview diversification is that – it kind of comes back  to this vagueness of the question, what does it mean to do the most good? So we're gonna try and do the most good with our money. And on one hand, I think there are times when it looks fairly clear that some things do more good than others.Giving to the Against Malaria foundation to distribute anti-malarial bed nets in Africa so that fewer children die of malaria, fewer people get sick versus giving to my alma mater, Harvard. I think that the malaria one does more good and I, I don't feel very conflicted about that. I think that's a call I'm fine to make.And then, though, if you wanna get all the way into it. What does it mean to do the most good? can get very complicated and can get very hairy, and you start to have these different ways of looking at the questions. So that's where the term worldviews comes in. I call them worldviews. They're intellectual frameworks that have radically different conclusions.So you can have an intellectual framework that says, what we're about here is we're about estimating the number of utility-translated benefits to people and maximizing that. And if you make your best guess at a bunch of probabilities, the result is gonna be that you should put, like, every dime into reducing existential risk and you should not give anything to helping people in poverty.And then there's like another worldview that says, kind of, I don't really reason by drawing out expected value diagrams and putting best guess probabilities on everything, and using this technique that I've called Bayesian mindset, that's not how I reason, and all this stuff is very speculative and I don't trust it, and I'm actually interested in doing something that's more robust, more evidence-backed within that, trying to maximize and do as much good as I can and help the most people possible, but I'm restricting myself to things that I pretty much understand and pretty much have evidence behind them. And then there's other worldviews that could come in and you could say, well, but I also feel really strongly that animals should be getting  some kind of competitive consideration to humans in terms of how much we should care about them.That might lead you to say, you should put all your money into, for example, corporate campaigns to help ensure that animals are treated better on factory farms, or that we hopefully eventually get rid of factory farming. Open Philanthropy does a ton of work on that. So you have these different worldviews. So it's like, if you take this set of assumptions or this framework or this way of thinking, it'll tell you to put all your money over here. If you take this other way of thinking, it'll tell you to put all your money over there. And to me, the best metaphor is it feels like it's these different Holdens arguing with each other. There's these different pieces of myself that are all trying to reach a deal. And in my view, a very natural way to handle that kind of dispute, if you have a bunch of different people who think in completely different ways, they're not speaking the same language, they're not using the same numbers, they don't even agree on what the numbers mean, what do you do? You divide up the resources. You say, hey, there's three of you. Maybe you each get a third.Or maybe you say, hey, there's three of you. One of you is making more sense to me. And so maybe one of them gets 60% and two of them each get 20%. But you divide it up and then you have these different worldviews that have their own budgets. And so it's like you could have the philosophy-driven Bayesian mindset bucket and you could have the practical, evidence-driven, human-focused bucket.And they're each maximizing how to do the good, the way that they do it, the best way that they can. They could even conceptually make trades with each other or something like that. That's worldview diversification; it's just the choice to say, Hey, we're not gonna be stuck with one worldview and put all the money into one kind of thing. We're going to take these different worldviews that tempt us and divide us and divide up the money between them. I should also say, I think this is kind of a naive, obvious thing to do when you have different parts of yourself arguing with each other. Then there's a bunch of arguments and it's actually wrong, and you actually should just put all the money into one thing and maximize expected value, and then there's a bunch of arguments against that, and that goes down a very deep rabbit hole.But my view is actually that the first intuitive thing is about as good as anyone's come up with.",
        "Holden: It's interesting. I mean it's an interesting kind of thought experiment and I think it may  be a bit of projection, like there might be some people in effective altruism who kind of are trying to turn themselves from humans into ruthless maximizers of something and they may be imagining an AI would do the same thing.I should say. I mean, my story about AI risk is like, kind of pointed in a similar direction. It has a very different flavor. I would just say, hey, like, humans being as powerful as we are and being able to develop the technologies we do has been a little bit of rough news for other animals. We've driven a lot of other species extinct, not because we're like single-mindedly trying to maximize the amount of, I don't know, babies we have or sugar that we eat, but just because we're powerful and there's things that we want and we want those things more than we want to be nice to the animals a lot of the time.And I think we should worry about AI being the same with respect to us, that I don't think you need some kind of weird God in a box to have a problem with AI. I've written about how if you just take it down a notch, just assume you built an AI that's basically able to do what a human could do. Some different strengths of weaknesses, but the same basic idea could do what a human could do. Then just like is, is a little bit different, just wants different things, has different values that doesn't have the same ethical rules that we have. If you imagine that, that's plenty scary because if you just had something like that, that could make copies of itself, that alone, you could get disaster from that. You do not need this weird alien psychology that's maximizing paperclips. You just need to think of it as, once there's what you could call a second advanced species on earth, another set of minds that is able to build its own technology like humans are, but is different from humans, wants different things from humans. We could actually be in a lot of trouble there and, and you don't need these exotic psychologies to get the problem.",

But I think in some cases, yeah, it  could be happening.music In the wake of the SBF scandal, a huge question hanging around effective altruism is this: What will the future of this movement look like?And that’s exactly what I’ll ask Holden…. after one last quick break.MIDROLL 2music ",
        "Holden: So it can be a little harder to talk about reforms, again, because it’s not like a top-down  thing. There aren’t existing rules, or like a place where you sign up and become a member. And so it's hard to kind of talk about changing them.But I guess a couple things I've thought, I mean, one is I definitely upgraded my sense of how concerned we should be about the proximity of these ideas, about the idea of, hey, it's cool to do a lot of good. And then the idea of hey, anything can be justified as long as you are reducing the probability of these, like, wild events that we talk about. These are two separate ideas. I'm into the first one, not into the second one, but it's not shocking that the two, you know, they're standing next to each other and, and it can be a problem.It's not really obvious what to do about that. But I think there are some things. One is I do think there could be more effort to actually just make the intellectual case. And a lot of people who are excited about effective altruism, they're not going to respond to people kind of saying, Hey, I'm offended. Please change. They're gonna respond to arguments. And I actually think the arguments are there. I think if you go further down the rabbit hole, it's like this first blush, you know, hey, utilitarianism, let's do the most good. That means it's all about the future generations. If you keep going down the rabbit hole, I think you can make a pretty good case for coming out the other end and saying, We are too confused and uncertain and lost to be all in on this framework, and actually doing some kind of moral parliament or worldview diversification is probably the thing to do – actually on more than one line of argument and on a bunch of different grounds. So, I think there could be more effort put into that than there has been. Unfortunately, the philosophy literature on moral uncertainty is pretty small. There hasn't been a ton written about it, and I think there could be more written about it. So I think that's something I'd like to see more of.",

I think that I, I simultaneously am saying to myself, hey, on one hand, I think that going down this track of being all in on utilitarianism and being a super maximizer is really dangerous.And on the other hand, just going along with what everyone around me is saying, and what's kind of in to think about what's right, also looks horrific. It looks horrible. Historically, it looks like such a terrible move. So I actually do vibe the goal of utilitarianism, as a lot of people practice it, which is to, Hey, let's be kind of scientific about it. Let's be systematic about it. Let's get ahead of the curve. Let's run some numbers. Let's think of the things that we'll think of later, and think of the things that we would think of if we had more reflection and wisdom. And that leads you down to science-y, maximizing direction. And then there's the moderation that leads you down a, hey, let's not get too carried away direction. And you're like, pick one, and I'm like, no, I'm not going to pick one. It's both. I think utilitarianism has a lot to recommend it. I think it's a compelling philosophy and I think there's a lot good about it. I think I've become more reasonable and smarter about morality and more thoughtful about morality because of my discussions with utilitarians and my consideration of utilitarianism, and there is part of me that is utilitarian for sure. So I think that's just what it is. I mean, what I am trying to do myself and what I would love to make arguments to other people interested in effective altruism to do, is to just live with that tension and just say, look, I'm a human being. I've got multiple voices arguing in my head all the time. I've gotta live with that. And we're gonna get along the way that any group gets along, we're going to try not to do anything that any one part of me totally hates too much. And we're gonna try to do all the things that any one part of me is super excited about as long as they're not totally unacceptable to the other parts, and just like a family or a team, that's how we're gonna get through life.

And you're like, what do you mean by better? Is it objective moral truth? I'm like, no, but it's better. The future-proof idea is me trying to square that circle and say, actually you don't have to believe in objective moral truths to believe in moral progress. The idea of future-proof ethics is kind of trying to get ahead of what we would think if we were wiser and did more reflection, which is different from finding an objective moral truth.",

Another analogy would be like, in baseball, there was kind of a moment where people went from evaluating players by watching them play to evaluating them by crunching a bunch of numbers, and what was the right answer? And it's just like: the right answer was always both. Today's baseball teams are just using both. And so I think that's where I'm at, is I'm just like, I don't want to just stick with conventional morality. I don't, and I don't want to reject utilitarianism overall, I think it has insights and things to offer us, and I don't wanna be all in on it until we have the full truth and full confidence, we're just gonna have to mix our system, and put 'em together in one place and live with that.",
        "Holden: I am very in favor of critical work of EA being welcomed and accepted and funded.

And I think that those jokes are sort of true, but I mean, I think that's a good thing. I think it's endearing.So I, I support that. I think when it comes to diversifying funding, I think it would be a lot better if EA had more diverse funding. And it's been unhealthy for Open Philanthropy to have such a large share of the funding for some of the causes that effective altruists work on. It's not a great situation. I'm not sure exactly what to do about it. So FTX actually, the FTX Foundation run by people who, as far as I know, I have no particular reason to think were involved in the FTX company practices. You know, they had a re-granters program, so they were actually taking, you know, a large number of people who were not at the foundation and saying, Hey, you can give away our money for us.And in some ways that's a diversifying move, but does that really change the power dynamics? Does that really spread it out? It all is still coming from the one source. And so I'm not sure I know literally how to… like, I think it's bad. I think it's bad that there's one funder that has so much of the money.I'm not sure that I have a solution in front of me, and I think that is kind of a tough situation.

And if there were more people providing a lot of the funding, there would be less pressure pointed at any one.",

Because we have something where everyone gets a voice and it is representative, and that's our government, that's our democracy.And so if you aren't wanting to send your money there, and having it spent the way it gets spent there, you're gonna have to make some kind of distinction that we're doing this based on a different set of values, a different mission, a different set of people. Who are those people? Who counts? Who's voting on where the money goes? How are they voting? Who gets how many votes? How long are they deliberating? And the people structuring that are gonna have a lot of power in a way that may be a little hard to understand, and it is still all gonna trace back to the people that have that money and choose to part with it.So I think the challenges are there, but I think it's also interesting and, and there could be experiments in that direction.",

You have a lot that you care about, and you have a job, and you work about as hard as, as a lot of people work at their jobs. You know, I'm not trying to do a lot of good by working especially hard or by being more self-sacrificing than other people.And it's like, if you can just clear that first hurdle and be kind of a multi-dimensional, healthy human being who's just working hard the way a lot of people work hard, you can do a huge amount of good, you can help a huge amount of people. And then that next step where you build your whole identity around it, you get rid of everything else in your life. You say, this is all that matters, and you'll do anything. That, I don't think it's adding very much. It may be adding negative. It may be making things worse by tempting people toward the sort of behavior that we're worried about. You know, I do have concerns about people working too hard, stretching too hard, making it their whole identity, burning out, going the opposite direction, and I do think you could do an enormous amount of good without doing any of that and adding all that dicey stuff on, getting you very marginal gains and, and very, in my opinion, very possibly getting you negative results so….You work hard and you do your best in the way that a lot of people do their best. It's a very unjust world out there, and you can do a lot of good, you can help a lot of people, and I think that is an idea that is core to effective altruism. It is really important and that, I think ultimately, I hope to see that idea gain in standing, not fall in standing, as time goes on.",

I do think there is a ton of value to coming at doing good with a mindset of finding the way to do the most good I can with the resources I have.I think that brings a ton of value compared to just trying to do some good. But then doing that in moderation I think does get you most of the gains and is ultimately where I think the most healthy place to be is.

        "Martha: That's absolutely right. And of course, we've also recognized the amazing abilities of  creatures that we used to think of as very stupid. We see now that birds are some of the most complicated creatures, and for a long time, they used the expression bird reign to need a real dummy. But that was because they thought that if they're physiologically not very like us, like birds don't have a neocortex, they could not possibly be very intelligent. But in fact by a different evolutionary path, birds arrived at similar destinations, and they have remarkable abilities.Now that we know so much more about animals, we can't afford to think in this crude way.",
        "Martha: Well, of course it's done great good in the world. And I think if we could only go as far  as that approach goes, that is curtailing needless pain, that would already be quite a lot. But basically Bentham's thought that the only good thing in life is pleasure and the only bad thing in life is pain. All the other things that people deem good and bad, are just variations on that one single theme. But that's much too simple because both humans and other animals pursue many different things in their lives. They want to have social relationships with one another. Animals don't need only to be free from pain. They need social relationships with other members of their species, often with members of other species. They also need lots of space to move around in. And sometimes they feel pain when they don't have those things – but not all the time because an animal grows up in a zoo in a single enclosure, it doesn't know – but it's a deprivation nonetheless. So in short, it doesn't take account of these many deprivations that animals, and of course humans – I mean, I've criticized utilitarianism for humans in similar terms – what we need is an approach that thinks of forms of life is complicated and having many different parts, not reducible to one thing. Another problem with utilitarianism is that it thinks about the good state as a state, that is, an animal should be in a state of pleasure, or in Singer's version should be in a state of satisfaction. But both humans and other animals don't want to end up in a kind of happy state. They want to be active, and they wanna be agents in creating their own lives. So just as in the human world, it gives bad guidance, making people think about, well, we'll give them some food, rather than trying to render them active in earning their own food and so forth. So it is a very bad way of dealing with human hunger and poverty. So too in the animal world, animals are active beings, and what they want is not just a comatose state of not being in pain. They wanna be active strivers.Then the third thing is that utilitarianism is very preoccupied with averages. So what is the social goal is supposed to be the greatest either total pleasure, or the greatest average pleasure, depending which version we use. But actually, that means that the ones who are at the bottom of society's ladder don't get any special attention. And that would mean that in the calculus between humans and other animals, might turn out that the pleasure of humans in eating meat and so forth would outweigh the pain inflicted on animals. So in short, it's not individual focused enough. It used individuals only as containers of pleasure and pain, rather than as separate beings who should be treated each one of them as an end, and none as a mere means to the ends of others.",
        "Martha: Okay, well the first thing to say is that Korsgaard diverges greatly from the historical  Kant who thought we could just use animals as means to our own ends. So she wants us to treat animals the way Kant thought we should treat humans. So that's great. And I'm all in favor of that. And I also should say, I mean, Korsgaard was actually my PhD student and she wrote a dissertation on Kant and Aristotle with me and John Rawls. And there is still a lot of Aristotle in the book. The Aristotelian part is that she sees animals, I think quite rightly, as creatures who pursue a wide variety of distinctive ends. And that that's what they should be able to do. So I agree with much of that. What I don't agree with is that she retains the focus on the idea of complicated ethical deliberation, which she thinks only humans are capable of. Now, she quite clearly says that doesn't make us better, but it does mean, she says, that only we can be active citizens producing the results that treat animals better. Now, I think that is just much too simple because animals are very active in indicating what they need and what they want. They have marvelous, complicated ways of speaking, signaling. Some are language-like, some are just indicative of their preferences. She calls animals passive citizens. They're not passive citizens. They have voices and they articulate what they need, and we should be listening to that and take account of that, just the way that right now I think we've learned that people with cognitive disabilities who may not be able to use human language, we should listen to them. And so I think that she's just treating animals in the end, too, in a somewhat condescending way by suggesting that they're not capable of indicating actively what they need.",
        "Martha: Well, first off, both Korsgaard and I agree that there's a sound argument for ascribing  rights to both humans and animals. Both of us find ourselves thrown into the world, a rather hostile world, needing all kinds of things, including property, to live and to do what we want to do. And it's a legal concept. I think that's what rights always are, is a legal concept. So what I think metaphysically has nothing to do with it, because my overall position, in my view, is that in political principles and legal principles, we should never include any controversial metaphysical positions. This is what John Rawls said famously in Political Liberalism that if we're in a pluralistic society where people differ about metaphysics, we should never include in our political principles these controversial metaphysical claims about which people differ. Now, Korsgaard does not – I mean, one of my problems with her book is that she never comes to grips with that argument of Rawls's. So she actually does allow herself to make some controversial metaphysical claims, namely that all value is the creation of various forms of subjectivity, et cetera. And I just think we shouldn't say anything about that one way or the other. We should try to frame our principles in a philosophically abstemious way. Not paring away the controversial metaphysical claims, but using the language of rights to talk about an ethical reality that's common to human and animal lives.",
        "Martha: Well, I mean like why so? I mean, we live together and we get along in many ways.  When the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was framed, people from many different cultures who had many different religions and metaphysical beliefs got together and said, well, we better not use the language of the immortal soul. We better not use this or that. But we can agree to use a thin common ethical language of human dignity, and that's what they agreed to base the Universal Declaration on. So I'm doing the same thing. I'm following that lead and doing it for similar reasons, that we want to get along in a world in which people disagree about fundamental metaphysics, about things like, is there an immortal soul, is there life after death, and so forth. Ethics too, of course, is controversial. But in ethics, if we leave out these religiously controversial things, I think people can actually come into an agreement.music If you ask me, Martha actually does make some controversial metaphysical claims. She argues that we can find out what objective moral rights an animal has… by looking at that animal’s objective capacities. How exactly does that work? That's what I'll ask her…. After a quick break.MIDROLL 1music ",
        "Martha: So for many years I've been part of a large group of economists and philosophers  working initially in human development ethics, who have been trying to urge that a good, normative theory of society's development when we're ranking societies to see how well they're doing is what we call the capabilities approach.Now, capabilities don't mean skills, they mean substantive opportunities for choice. So a capability is not, in other words, a skill that you have. It's an opportunity out there in the world that you have, which of course has to be aided by law and society, to choose various things that you value.So the central question that we think should be asked in ranking nations in terms of their development is not what is their GDP per capita, and not even how satisfied are the people, the utilitarian view. But rather, what are people actually able to do and to be? So it focuses up close on the strivings of people and the various obstacles that come between people and the things that they wanna get. And then it asks, what are they actually able to do and to be? And the answer to that question is the capability set that that person has. So for a long time that's been used and it's used in the human development reports of the United Nations Development Program as a comparative measure of different human societies.Now, what I then did was to take the next step and to use it as a normative benchmark of basic justice. I said, well, we want to go further and not just compare A with B, but to say, what is a minimally just society? And then what you have to do in order to do that is to say, which capabilities would be the most important, like a bill of basic rights for that society.  And what I do in a variety of books that I've written on this is to say there are 10 basic capabilities that a minimally just society would foster, focusing on protection of life, protection of health, protection of bodily integrity, and a whole list of others. But see already, in one of the books that I wrote on this approach, I said that this approach can be extended to non-human animals. You can see the natural extension because animals too are trying to get things that they value and they have various impediments. But over the years I've gathered a small group of people around me who talk about this and we try to work it out. And now I think I'm ready to work it out in, in great detail to say, what would a capabilities approach for animals be like? Now, the basic idea is that each creature would be entitled to have a minimal threshold level of opportunity to pursue the most important activities that are characteristic of its form of life, as a member of that species.So the idea is that, that means we look at a lot of different parts of the creature's life. It's not like utilitarianism in reducing everything to pleasure and pain. We say, well, what is it for an elephant to live well? And then we look at the different parts of an elephant's life that elephants seem to value – and of course here you need to turn to people who actually have studied elephants in great detail and listened to them for years and years and years. And then you make the elephant capabilities list, this is what elephants should have. You make a different list for baboons, for birds and so on. So, but each creature in its own way should be able to have a minimal level of opportunity to pursue the characteristic activities of that creature.And now I say, should be able to, because it leaves space for choice.So there are dolphins who are solitary and they don't wanna go around with a large pod of dolphins. Fine. But they need to have that choice, that opportunity space.",
        "Martha: Yeah, well of course at the very high level of generality, there's gonna be a lot of  overlap with the human list, because play is on the human list, too. But the form of play and the form of social engagement will be very different.  And some creatures only need their own kind. They might like relationships with other species, but they don't need them. I think that's true of dolphins. It's true of elephants. But some creatures, particularly dogs, cats, horses, are characteristically social across the species barrier. And they particularly seem to need relationships with humans.So we add that in and so forth.",
        "Martha: Yeah, because there are people who think, oh, this is bad, that they depend on  humans. I've known people who would just like to let all the dogs and cats free, and not have humans being in charge of them in any way. But of course, the thing is, now they've evolved in such a way that they're thoroughly dependent on humans. They cannot live well without humans. There are people who think we should therefore not breed them at all and let them go out of existence, but I don't hold that view and I actually argue against that. But that means that their good will be defined in a way that includes human relationships.",
        "Martha: Oh yeah. Absolutely.  Well, I mean, the first thing is the word pet. I think the word pet is insulting to animals. It suggests they're toys to be played with. And I do think that there are a lot of people who think with. And during Covid, a lot of people adopted a dog or a cat because they were lonely. And then they took them back again now that they can go out and socialize.So, no, I would use the term companion animals. And I would ask the question what it is for a companion animal to live well. And I do think that society has to change quite a lot. So just starting there, most societies now have quite a lot of laws protecting companion animals from cruelty. Those laws are not very well enforced. So that brings us to the larger issue of animals lack legal standing. They can't be a plaintiff in a court action. A child with minimal cognitive ability, a human child, even though they couldn't of course go to court themselves, they can go to court represented by a guardian. And if they're being abused, there can be a suit brought on with them as the plaintiff.That can't be the case right now for dogs. But it should be the case. If a dog is being abused and there is a law against it, then they can sue to demand enforcement of the law through a suitable guardian. What I have in mind, actually, for dogs and cats is very similar to what we now do with child welfare. Every city, every state has a Department of Child Welfare services. And for example, I, as a member of a university that has some projects that use young children, and so there are young children on our campus – I have to take every year a two hour course in child welfare so that, even though I'm not part of any of those projects, if I see a child on our campus who's being abused in any way, I become a mandatory reporter. And I must then right away call the Department of Child Welfare and say there's abuse to a child here.I think the same thing should be true with companion animals and with any animal who lives in close proximity to humans. Namely that we would all become mandatory reporters of abuse to those animals. Now, what that would mean for dogs and cats would simply be more adequate enforcement of the laws that are there already. And it would be also more attention to things like the needs of dogs for adequate exercise. The law doesn't even really cover that, because most people don't give their dogs adequate exercise. They think it's okay to keep a large dog indoors most of the day and then maybe walk it once in the morning and once at night. And they don't notice that it has tremendous psychological and physical impact on the health of that dog. For animals that are raised for food, oh boy. All the animal protective laws at both the federal, state, and local level consciously omit the animals we raise for food. So the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which is a very good law that was put in around the turn of the 20th century to protect migratory birds. But birds that are raised for food unh huh, they're not covered by that act. And the same is true for the Animal Welfare Act, another very good federal law – it even specifies how animals must be given adequate water, adequate food – but it doesn't have anything to say about the animals that are raised for food. Now, I guess my end point would be that we don't eat animals at all. For the most part, to prematurely deprive a sentient animal of life is wrong. So I think if there's actually going to be eating of meat, I would like in the long term to see it be only that kind of stem cell grown meat that we're beginning to hear about so much now.",
        "Martha: And that, you know, tastes like meat, but it doesn't involve killing. So that would be the long term. But in the short term, I'm an incrementalist and I think we need to start by stamping out the worst abuses. And right now the whole factory farming industry is a horror show. And it's so bad that they've even gone to great lengths to get state laws forbidding people to tell what's going on there. ",
        "Martha: Yes, because they know that if people know about that, they would rise up in protest.  music Do the animals living in our homes or on our farms deserve more of our concern than animals out there in the wild? That's coming up…. After one last quick break.MIDROLL 2music ",

But what the capabilities approach, as you quite rightly say, does promise a creature, is the chance to fulfill their striving over a reasonably long life.Now, I mean here I'm not alone, I'm together with Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka in their book Zoopolis, who think that the egg industry can actually be reformed in order to be ethically adequate in the way that you describe. Because eggs, cage-free eggs and eggs that are curated in the way you describe, can still make a profit. And that's happening, actually, about half the United States is now cage-free. And yet eggs are still sold and they still, it's still a business that people are willing to go into. ",
        "Martha: Oh yes, this is always a difficult thing when we make choices for animals. It comes up  when we ask, should I sterilize my cat? But I think here we have to use a principle of hypothetical consent, thinking about the alternatives in front of that animal ,and thinking what they would say if they were aware of the alternative and they had a choice to make.Now, in the case of the egg, what the hen gets satisfaction out of is having some offspring and raising them, and the number is not so significant. But in the case of sterilization, it's more tricky. If you think about, let's say a male cat, the alternatives before the male cat would be to be a terrible nuisance and not find a good home, and therefore be abandoned to the street. Or to be neutered. And therefore, many humane organizations, and in fact most, are now mandating sterilization for the animals that are up for adoption because they know that the alternative is the street. And then with the female animal, I think it's even clearer, because pregnancy is not chosen by that female animal who is mounted by a male animal. And most female animals will be depleted and exhausted by too many pregnancies, just like a human. Now, of course, they can't know that and they don't see any alternative. I think in the long run, maybe we'll get animal contraception developed and there would be other options. But right now the option for a female animal is pregnancy after pregnancy, the children of which inevitably would not all find good homes, and they would be abandoned to the street. Or, neutering at some point. And I think the ideal point of neutering would be after the cat or dog has had one litter. I do think that's a satisfaction that the creature ought to have. If we were in a world where there were not hundreds and countless strays being abandoned to the street, that would be my best policy.",
        "Martha: Well, there is no place unless maybe on some other planet that is not right now  controlled by human beings. Take the land, all the animals that are so-called wild animals or on wildlife refuges that are curated by nations or in various kinds of spaces within nations that belong to those nations and are superintended by them and that are impacted by habitat depletion and various kinds that are human.Take the air, again, I mean, the conditions in which birds live are impacted by humans and humans control the kind of atmosphere we have now, the pollutants in it and all of the dangers to birds that come with that; the buildings, the birds crash into and so forth. Then in the seas, which might seem to be the last great frontier of wildness, humans are everywhere. We control the amount of plastic that is endangering the digestion of marine mammals. We control the amount of noise – this is a thing people don't realize. Most marine creatures navigate more by hearing than by sight or smell. And the noise pollution that's out there from humans is incredible.So, I mean, of course most of these examples are examples of bad things that we've created, but the truth is there's absolutely no clear line between the conditions we've created and conditions that would be there if we were had never existed, that's just a thought experiment that we can't do anymore because we don't know what the world would be like if humans had never existed.So what we do know is that right now we're in the driver's seat. We control the shape of those habitats, whether air, land, or sea. And we can do a lot to make them more conducive to animal flourishing.",
        "Martha: Well, population imbalance is almost always caused ultimately by things that humans  control because for example, why is it the villagers in Botswana think there are too many elephants? Well, it's because they've allowed human population to grow so much and the villages are are multiplying. And therefore the elephants are squeezed and they come into the villages and they strip the bark from the trees and then the villagers cry out.And so in general, it's always a question of balance and humans never attend to the balance. And so usually when there seem to be too many wild horses, say the ranchers in Wyoming. Well, why do they say there are too many wild horses? They say that because they want to use the land for grazing their future factory-farmed cattle.So it's always about humans trying to grab something that the animal might like to have.I think that if there's a population imbalance, first of all, humans have to control the human numbers. That's the first thing. But then there are sometimes cases where, let's say the habitat could support a certain number of elks, but the elks have done well, so they're reproducing rapidly. And people say, oh, there are too many elks. Probably, in this case, they're not saying it in a simply selfish way, but they're just noticing that the elks don't get enough to eat.",
        "Martha: What do we do?  Well, one possibility is we introduce hunting. People can shoot the elks. I don't like that for obvious reasons. Second possibility, we introduce wolves so that they tear apart the elks. Well, I don't like that because it's a more painful death for the elks than it would be than even a bullet to the head.So I think better than either of those alternatives would be – I mean, I suppose we concluded that humans have not really caused this problem, I still think that animal contraception should be investigated as part of the solution. Because with human population, we've learned how to do contraception. With animals, we haven't really learned forms of contraception that don't damage the animal. We need to work on that. But if we do the research and we get forms of contraception that don't impinge on the life of the animal – and we have actually done that for smaller animals, for rats, for example. So rather than having exterminators leaving out poison for rats right now a lot of cities are using contraception for rats, which is much less cruel, and it's quite effective.",
        "Martha: Yeah.  ",
        "Martha: Well, I think right now the answer is no. But I do think we should regard it as a problem.  Because these creatures suffer just as much as being killed by another animal as they would if they were being killed by a human. And where we live with an animal, we always do interfere. We don't encourage cats to kill little birds. We teach them a substitute behavior. And so long as the cat is happy with the substitute behavior, like, say, a lot of scratching or whatever, then things are okay. So we need to at least investigate substitute behaviors for animals who are under our control in the wild. But given that we don't know how to do that, and given that it's really, we'll mess it up if we attempt to do that, right now I think the main thing is don't make money off of cruelty, which is happening. So most eco safaris involve people who love cruelty paying a lot of money to the tourist agencies in Botswana or whatever to go and see this predation taking place, and I call this sado-tourism. So I think the first step that we could take in the direction of limiting predation is not to encourage it to happen by having an industry that makes a lot of human money off of it. And that might mean that that species of wild dog would ultimately become extinct. But for me, it's not the species that matters, it's the individual creatures.",
        "Vienna: So my title is Marriage and Family Therapist. I work with individuals, couples, and  families, all within the context of relationships and really understanding the origin, pain and wounds that we accrue in our childhoods. So the lens through which I see people and relationships is through their family of origin, the family system or systems in which they grew.To see that there is a larger system at play in every moment, right? When we have unwanted patterns in our adult lives, we keep getting into the same conflict with a partner or a parent. We keep choosing emotionally unavailable people to date. We're chronically unhappy at every job that we hold. For me, if we can't create a quick change, right, if there's resistance there, if there's friction there, then that's a pretty good indicator that there's something unresolved from our past.And the place that I like to go is our family. I like to understand the template, right? That's our first education on just about everything. You know, we obviously get other people in there at different points, teachers, coaches, religion, et cetera, right? Like all of these influences that start to shape our belief systems.But our family system is the first system where that education is, is handed over to us. A lot of times when people come in for individual therapy, it's really easy to just stay focused on that one person's experience, you know, the story that they're sharing. And I try to always keep other people in the room even when they're not there physically.We all know that we have complex histories. We have a story that is rich, and when we can keep that in mind when we're thinking about relational patterns that are breaking down, that's so helpful to remember that our partner, or our parent, or our sibling has a lot of context that's worth understanding.",
        "Vienna: Yeah. Right, and I think you're right that a lot of people can say like, sure, I can connect  some of these dots and that makes a lot of rational sense. But I am a big believer that the unresolved pain from our past comes along with us. Our pain is not out to destroy our lives. Our pain is not out to ruin us, right?Our wounds are tugging at us because they want attention and they find these really clever ways, right? Like our internal system is brilliant and super fascinating, the ways in which it will bring us back into contact with pain that is unresolved. And what we know to be true is that relationships are the greatest way for that pain to play itself out over and over and over again.So, whether it's a romantic partnership, whether, you know, the listeners who have children, who know our children are such great mirrors for us, and they bring us into contact with a lot of that stuff, right? It's like relationships are where so much of that plays out. You know, you have so many people who are like, okay, I'm here to understand it.But understanding only takes us so far. There's only so much that we can do as individuals thinking about, and yeah, maybe processing on our own as well, but I find that if it's relationships that contributed to our pain, then it's relationships that need to contribute to our healing as well. And so, yeah.Why we really need to explore this through the context of relationships.",
        "Vienna: There are many things I want to know about. Probably one of the first questions is,  what did you want as a child and not get? That'll bring us right to it, you know, even noticing like, oof. Yeah. Is there like a little bit of feeling sensation just hearing that question right now. You know, my parents, part of what got me into this work, of course, is my own personal story, unsurprisingly, for all therapists.When people are like, how did therapists get into this work? It's like, yeah, we're figuring out how to resolve our unresolved pain, right? My parents, they went through a nine-year divorce process. It was the longest divorce at the time for New Jersey. It was intense and there was just a lot of high conflict.There was a lot of psychological abuse, manipulation, gaslighting, paranoia, emotional flooding, like it was not an easy system to grow up in. And I'm an only child, so as a tiny little human, I was really there on my own. And I think my parents obviously did what they could, and all of my main needs were taken care of.But, I took on this role of seeing the adults in my life crashing and burning around me. I believed that there wasn't room for me to not be okay, because my perception of them was that they were not okay. That not only were they not okay, they were drowning. And so I started to fly under the radar. I started to pretend like I was fine.I was unaffected by things. I didn't wanna add any type of stress or burden to their already full plates. And, that role, you know, I took on and I kept it for decades, you know, it wasn't until late in my twenties and it clicked in at one moment in a conversation with a friend. It's like, ah, this needless little girl who pretended like she was unaffected by all of the things that were going on in her life and in her family became a needless woman who was presenting as the quote unquote “cool girl,” right?This woman who, yeah, do whatever you want. I'm totally fine. I'm totally unaffected. No worries. I was fully boundaryless, and that role had come along with me, and I was maintaining this position in my relationships. You know, I couldn't speak up in romantic partnerships. I couldn't speak up in friendships.I just was pretending that I was so unbothered and unaffected by things. And it wasn't until that moment where I could make a pivot and actually for the first time say, ‘I'm not okay. I am affected by this.’ That might sound so simple, but that was a life-changing moment for me to let those words actually come out.And I share that story because we can sometimes see so clearly how our past comes with us, but other times it comes in such subtle ways, right? Whether we're recreating and repeating certain patterns, or whether we're taking a path of opposition where we don't even see what's going on. And you know, for me it is so important to not just understand, but to do the processing work in order to shift that and find a new path forward.",
        "Vienna: Yeah. It points us though, to, you know, in the book I talk about five origin wounds and  you know, my answer to that question led me to an origin wound that really needed my attention. I wanted to know that it was okay for me to not be okay.",
        "Vienna: Yeah. So in the beginning of the book, I share a story. I was in first grade and that  particular weekend was supposed to be the three of us. And you know, my dad was watching a Yankees game. My mom wanted to go to the beach, he didn't wanna go. And she invited my grandmother to come along with us. And you know, I'm this little girl behind a closed door in her bedroom and I hear, if you leave, don't come back.And, you know, the next thing I know is that my mom's barreling upstairs, having me pack a bag and we're leaving. And there's a lot that happens after that. You know, we don't go home. We go to my grandmother's home, police are involved. I'm hiding in a closet, you know, instructed to not make a sound.Yeah. There's this rupture that makes me have to split my loyalty, like, how do I take care of mom and dad? How do they both know that I love them? And all of a sudden I'm in this position where I'm having to choose one over the other. And so, you know, that was the, that was the catalyst, right?That was the, the rupture that then led into the nine year divorce process. And, you know, all of that contributes to the lack of emotional safety, psychological safety as well.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, so self-sabotage: I'd reframe it as something that is self-protective. What does it  serve to do the thing that you do, even though you know you ought not do it? Like I said before, our systems are brilliant, and so we're constantly working in a way to protect ourselves from something. Now, unfortunately, a lot of times that's an old operating system, right? It's protecting us from something that's unresolved, unhealed, right? As opposed to protecting us in the sense that it's supporting and working us towards our goals and our healing and connection. I wonder if you and I have some similarities. It sounds like maybe. You didn't get too specific with that, but it makes me think about a story.When I was first dating my now husband, we were in a conflict, no idea what the conflict was about, but I remember acutely that I could not stop proving my point, and I just kept going. I doubled down, I tripled down, and I was having this out of body experience where I was like, Vienna, shut up. You know, just like, stop.Can you take it back? You know, there was a lot of shame and embarrassment there. I was like, I could see this part of me that just like needed to be right, needed to prove my point, and yet I couldn't stop myself from it. And I realized like, okay, what does point-proving serve? Right? What does the need to be right protect me from? And I grew up with a father who was really manipulative. He gaslit my mom and he was really quick with his words, you know, he was really, really good at it. And as a tiny human, I watched this and I saw the impact that it had on my mother. It was, it was quite literally crazy-making. And so I started to understand that my need to be right was my way of protecting myself. That being wrong was quite dangerous for me, right? That's what I had learned, right? That being wrong meant that I would be manipulated, that I would be taken advantage of, right? And so being right was safety for me. Proving my point was the way in which I safeguarded myself from the things from the past.That was such an important revelation for me because I needed to understand that, okay, yes, as a little girl, that made a lot of sense. But if I kept at this, right, if I didn't start to pay attention to that unresolved pain of what I saw growing up, then I would continue to loop into that, and I needed to find a way to process and witness that and grieve the pain from the past so that I could make a new choice in this current relationship, right?Because I did not have a partner who was manipulative. I have a very honest, kind, loving, open partner, and if I did not change that, you run the risk of having relationships end. Right? Like that's, that's the consequence to all of this.",
        "Vienna: Absolutely. Right. I mean, I think we go in the direction of familiarity, but I wa, like,  where does it lead you? You know, when you engage in whatever the destructive behavior is, where do you get to?",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm. Conflict. And then how do you feel when you're in that escalation and  conflict?",
        "Vienna: Yeah. Right. So, okay. One, where did you learn that from? Two, what does that  protect you from? Three. What story does that wind up ultimately supporting for you?",
        "Vienna: Well, but you're describing a hypervigilance right?  ",
        "Vienna: Like the part of you that's constantly scanning and pre-preparing for something to go  wrong, and the inquiry would be, what's familiar about that? When did you have to prepare? Right? Why did you need to look out for things going wrong? Why did you need to look out for things going south?It's not to put you on the spot, but I imagine that there is some history in your life where you learned that there's a need for hypervigilance.",
        "Vienna: Certainly. To have young parents who are figuring it out often creates an environment  where a child has to do some figuring out themselves. I don't know if that resonates for you, but they don't necessarily know what to be thinking of next, or, because there's an immaturity that might have been there, then you have to become the observer, the hyper-vigilant one, or just vigilant one to say, well, hey, my needs over here. Hey, we've gotta look out for this. Or, Hey, what about that? If they're not as attuned or aware, which can happen when we have adults stepping into a role that maybe is slightly premature for them.It reminds me of this one story that I share in the book about Natasha, and she's coming into therapy and she's trying to figure out whether or not she should stay in the relationship with Clyde, who is this wonderful man, but she keeps thinking that the other shoe is going to drop and she doesn't know why, and at first she doesn't wanna talk about her family, past at all.She's like, no, like I'm here to figure out if I should stay with him or not. We're about to get engaged and I need this answer. And a little bit into our therapy. I learned that when she was a teenager, she stumbled upon an email that was open on her father's computer, and it was between her father and a woman who wasn't her mother.He walks in on her, he sees her crying. He says, please don't tell your mother or sister. I promise I'll cut it off. And she holds that secret for him, forever. It was the first time that she had spoken that out loud to anyone, right was to me in that session decades later. She had absorbed it in such a way and then had to go on pretending like nothing had ever happened, which makes sense as to why she said, you know, I have a great family and great, great childhood, that it didn't strike her, that the other shoe dropping came from this origin story.And she was going through life in her romantic relationships, waiting for the other shoe to drop, exiting those relationships early for really no reason, but just, because of the anticipation of something could go wrong, you cannot trust people even if they present like they are phenomenal humans. Right? And that was such an opener for us because it brought us to the part of her that needed to process the origin pain, that needed to witness this teenager who was asked to hold a secret, who did, and what that did to her.And then to grieve the emotions that were there so that she could then choose to be committed and move forward with a partner who was actually a great fit and really aligned for her. And so you can see how sometimes when we don't have that awareness, the past unresolved or untouched pain can create and maintain these behaviors and these patterns.And so for you, or for anybody who's listening who resonates with this, right? Like, that's the inquiry.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, right. Not always. And of course I, I recognize that not every wound of ours gets  created in childhood. It's just the framework that I use when I'm doing my work. But yeah, the breach of trust is so brutal because we all know that it's so hard to work our way back from it. And you're right, we have the big ones, right, the obvious ones, and infidelity, somebody gambling away your education fund or something like that.But then we also have the things like parents who make promises that they don't follow through on. And it might feel small, but that's something that starts to teach a child whether or not they can trust another person to follow through on what they're saying. I think when it's our parents or the adults who are in our parental roles, who teach us that we are not worthy, who communicate to us that we are not a priority, or that you can't trust other people, or that you're not safe in the world. This is a really hard thing to come back from because as kids, we look to our parents, to the adults as truth. We don't have the capacity to process properly, right? If I'm not worthy in the eyes of my parent, then there's no way that I'm worthy in the eyes of anybody else. If I can't trust the people who are supposed to love me, protect me, nurture me, guide me…Then what do you mean I'm supposed to trust other people? That's a real conundrum for a lot of folks.music How do you draw the line between self love… and self-indulgence?I’ll ask Vienna… after a short break.MIDROLL 1Music",
        "Vienna: Yeah, I mean, I think the absence of self-love really intersects with these wounds,  right? Like when you don't feel deserving or good enough that there were conditions for love, right? I needed to perform, be perfect, be a people pleaser, be the comic relief, whatever it is in order to get connection, attention, love, presence, et cetera.Right? And maybe I should just name worthiness, belonging, prioritization, trust and safety are the five wounds that I go over. What we'll see is that those things strip away at our confidence. They strip away at the self, right? This belief that I belong as I am. So with a belonging wound, a lot of times families have this narrative, like this is what it looks like to be a part of this family. This is what we believe, this is what we do, this is how we show up in the world. And some of that is beautiful, right? The traditions that we have with a family, that might be lovely, but other parts of that are where we're asked to trade our authenticity for attachment. Dr. Gabor Mate talks about that being our two lifelines, attachment and authenticity.But when, when attachment is threatened, a child will trade authenticity in an instant in order to survive. And so we start to see how all of these things strip away from our capacity to hold ourselves in high regard, or even just regard. To pick ourselves up and believe that we are deserving of, to believe that we can just be ourselves, and that that is enough, to believe that we are important in the world, to believe that there are people in this world whom we can trust, or to believe that there is care and concern for our overall well being. And so self-love to me is not, you know, sure you wanna throw in some bubble baths and yeah, those are great things for us from time to time. But I talk about self-love as the intersection of grace and compassion for the self, as well as accountability and ownership.And we have to see ourselves as a part of the human experience, but we also need to take accountability and ownership. And when we don't do that, we're stuck. The self-critic is totally turned up right? That inner voice that just has a lot to say about who we are and what we're doing and doesn't seem to have any problems letting us know.And so, like, we stay stuck in that space instead of moving to a place of agency, I think you said before. Yeah.",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's right. All of this stuff is the bandaid. It can take us to a certain  point. We can fake it. Okay. I'll be perfect and I can fake it for a little bit or, yeah. I'll trade authenticity and do what I need to do to fit in. Okay. We can fake it for a little bit, and it might give us the outcome that we want.Maybe people give us validation or they might give us attention, or they might wanna spend time with us, but it ends. We cannot keep that up forever. And that's why I say it's so important for us to go into the origin pain. So for the, the man you're describing, he needed to spend time witnessing the pain about his family rejecting him. There were constraints there. His sexuality was something that they could not really comprehend from the south, very religious family, right? And so there were a lot of constraints there. And he overheard his mom after he had come out, say like, why is he ruining my life? You know, those like daggers that really, really hurt him and tore him apart.And when we just scurry by that, right, when we just brute force our way through, when we white knuckle it, when we're just like, okay, I'm just gonna keep on going and not try to tend to the pain. What winds up happening is we maintain that I'm not worthy, that I'm not lovable, that I'm not a priority, that I do not fit in, that I don't belong, that I'm not safe, that there is nobody to trust in the world.Those things just keep circulating and, you know, maintaining the pain. It was so important for people to come back into contact with the original pain that set all of these patterns in motion.",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Vienna: Yeah, probably. I mean, I think you're right. In theory we're like, of course it does, but  until you're in it, you know, we don't necessarily understand the strain that it has on you. Obviously we know that there are such beautiful parts to it, such expansive parts, and there's also really hard stuff that presents itself and yeah, I think we probably do underestimate, listen, I'm, and I know you too, we're, we're still in the early part of parenthood. I can tell how easy it is for resentment to present very early on when you step into parenthood. And I don't know if you experienced that too, but I think my husband and I, we have such a great team and that was still there. That piece of, are we doing things equally and who's contributing what? And you know how quick it is for resentment to start to creep in. And the expectations, you know, when we're doing this type of healing work too. Seeing yourself as parent and what that brings forward for you in terms of your relationship with your own, or, you know, thinking back to when you were a tiny human and how you want to offer a very different experience for them.Or a similar experience, right? If you had a really great one. There's so many layers that start to reveal themselves, and until you're in the thick of it, I think it's hard to fully know what's gonna show up there.",
        "Vienna: They're hard, and I think it's interesting too because, depending on what type of  wounds you might have, there are certain things that might activate us even more. So, for example, if you are a parent who has a prioritization wound, meaning you didn't feel important growing up, maybe you had a parent who was a workaholic, or maybe there were mental health challenges in the family system that took up the space, or addiction that took up the space.If that's the wound, and then you have this third party come into the equation and then all of a sudden, the other partner is spending a lot of time with that third party — baby — and all of that love and connection is going there all of a sudden. Even though we can rationalize it and say, of course it's a baby.This is what we do, yada, yada, yada. It doesn't mean that the wound isn't getting activated. Right? All of a sudden I am deprioritized now. ",
        "Vienna: Or, if we have a worthiness wound. And so unless I am showing up as a perfect parent,  because that's what I learned, that in order to be loved, right, I needed to be perfect. And now here I am in this new role where, oh my gosh, I have no idea what I'm doing. I feel nervous. I'm a little scared. I'm not sure I trust myself. All the things right.Then it activates that piece, and so obviously every parent's journey is different, right? And the things that activate us within that space, and I'm not just saying in relation to the child. Within the coupleship too, you'll start to see like what are the things that make me most reactive here? Our reactivity, when we have strong reactions, it's a neon sign that directs us back to our wounds.I'm pissed that I'm not getting time with my partner. I feel like you're prioritizing our child over me. Just noticing what's showing up is gonna remind us and tell us where we need to go spend more time.",
        "Vienna: Shape shifting. ",
        "Vienna: And I think when you start your own family for the first time, ",
        "Vienna: Do I belong here? Can I be a part of something here? Even when it's partnership,  right? There's that sense, and then you bring somebody else into the mix and you're like, wow, okay, what I had, and you've got the, the same equation now. Right? Now your child is an only child, and to think about what that reflects back to you and what am I creating, but also can I make space to feel a part of something here, as well?Can I receive that? Right? Or am I finding ways to block that?",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I love the question, and I think I said it earlier: What does this pattern  serve?",
        "Vienna: Yeah. And you might not be able to do it in the moment. I think a lot of times when  we're hot, there's not a lot of cooling down that can happen right away. So in a moment of reflection, whether that's a few hours later, the next day, the next week, or right now, before something even happens, right? To notice, like, what are the things that make me the most reactive?What do the patterns in my life, the things that I want to change, what does this serve? Now, we're gonna say it doesn't serve anything. All it does is cause problems. All it does is cause disconnection. All it does is cause dysfunction in my relationships. But it still serves something. And my example that I shared before was, it served my need to protect myself.It served my need that being right meant that I was safe. And so whatever it is that you're doing that you can't stand, that you're trying to change, it's doing something that your system thinks is for you. Does that make sense?",
        "Vienna: it's a pause. ",
        "Vienna: Well, remember, earlier on in this chat we talked about that it's not just about us, it's  about the other person that is in the equation with us, right? That they also have a history, that they also have wounds, and so: yes, individually, this is a pause, and probably a pretty good one. You know that it's gonna escalate. That never ends well, and so I'd rather not escalate. But what we're missing is whether or not you stepping away activates something in the other person. And if we don't talk about that, right, if there isn't an agreement, then that's something that can cause a different type of a rupture. So for example, if the other person has an abandonment wound, or they feel like you stepping away doesn't honor their emotional safety, for example, or they feel deprioritized when you say, I'm outta here, I'm not gonna keep having this conversation. And all of a sudden that activates a prioritization wound, right? Like that's what's so important and that's so relationship-specific, it's to say, what's gonna work for the two of you? Right? And how do you co-create that with the idea and understanding of what's at play so that we can tend to, and like care for the other person's experience while also caring for our own. So yeah, it, it sounds like it's a good pause for you, but I would get curious about whether it's a good pause for the other person too.",
        "Vienna: Yes. ",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Vienna: Hmm. Probably that they don't come to it sooner. You know, like that the, that they  don't come to the awarenesses sooner.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, and I, cuz I think what's important is that we're not so hard and difficult on  ourselves. Like a lot of times people will come in and they're like, I know I'm starting way late. And it's like, no, like you're, you, you know, we're stepping into something when we're ready for it.And I think it's important, again, to have that grace and compassion for ourselves instead of like, oh, my life or my relationships could have been so different 10 years ago. And it's like, sure, you know, that that could have been true, but, here we are. You know, that doesn't really serve anything for us to just think that way and blame ourselves, but I think that's one of the things that people struggle with is, oh, I wish that I had been readier to confront this sooner.Because the beauty of this work is that we gain internal peace. It changes our relationships and the quality of our relationships, certainly. But there is a beautiful internal peace that happens when we do this work. When people get a taste of that and they're like, huh, I don't have to be in suffering all the time. I understand why that regret can pop up.",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Vienna: Yeah, but the trivial stuff is connected to our pain.  ",
        "Vienna: We don't do stupid shit just because it's fun. You know? We don't fight about the  toothpaste cap and the toilet, you know, just the stupid, you know, examples that we've had for so long, right? It's like no one's doing that because we actually care about that.",
        "Vienna: Right? So this trivial surface level stuff is connected to legitimate pain that we carry. You know, I've worked over 20,000 hours of individuals, couples, families, in therapy, and this is what I have seen over and over and over again. My personal life and my professional life. It points us to these wounds. And when we can tend to those wounds, then we can begin to create those changes.You know, you said something before about the change that you would like to see. This is what I want it to look like, and I think there's an inquiry there about what would you need to believe in order for that to happen? ",
        "Vienna: What do you need to believe about yourself in order for that to actually happen?  There's so much that can birth from that.",
        "Vienna: That’s right. ",
        "Vienna: So, I walk the reader through a four-step process. My origin healing practice, where the  first part is about naming and identifying the wound. Do not be surprised if you have multiple, so you're naming what wound or wounds you resonate with and identify with. The second part of the practice is witnessing, so… yeah, the part of the self, again, that just wants to move on. We don't tend, we don't acknowledge and see ourselves very well, and the witnessing step is about that. Now, I'm a big believer in witnessing the self. I'm also a big believer in having another human whom we trust, who loves us, somebody we're safe with, do witnessing as well.What's really important for people to hear is that the person or people who contributed to the origin wound do not need to participate in the witnessing of it now. They don't need to participate in the healing of it in any way. In fact, I would say probably more times than not, I hear people say like, yep, my parent just can't acknowledge it, or they're super defensive, or all they do is explain why they did what they did. Right? And like, and people keep going there. over and over and over again. Well, maybe if I say it this way, or maybe if I write them a letter instead of speaking it to them, or maybe if I'm really kind, or maybe if I get really angry, like what way will it get through?And I think sometimes when we get caught in this space of needing the person that we so badly want to acknowledge it, to be the person who has to do it, we get trapped in this cycle and can't find a way forward. And so oftentimes witnessing the younger self, I remember when I was, gosh, I must have been like seven or eight years old. I would find these like sneaky ways to pick up the telephone and listen in on my parents' conversations, or I'd perch myself at the top of the steps and there was like a little opening where I could listen in to the conversation that my mom was having on the phone, you know, becoming this detective and trying to figure out who's telling the truth or what's going on.I needed that information and I remember the first time that I really closed my eyes and kind of transported myself as an adult, witnessing from afar, you know, if you were seeing it on a movie screen, uh, it was maybe a few feet away from my seven, eight year old self perched atop those stairs, but I just got there and I was watching her.Watching her listen in, watching her absorb the fighting, all of the conflict, all the anger, the yelling, and just seeing her, you know, again, I didn't have siblings. Neither of my parents ever remarried. There were no stepparents or anybody else. There's just no validation, right? And so there was something really important about being able to witness what I had gone through through my adult clear lenses today. And so that was so important for me to do, and it's been really important for people I work with to do that witnessing or to have a loving partner do that as well. The third part is grieving. Woof. People are like, oh, I don't want to, when in doubt, grieve more, when stuck. Grieve more.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, right. It's very intentional. This is never about us wallowing, getting stuck, being  in some type of victim position. This is about feeling what needs to be felt.",
        "Vienna: And sometimes I think when we have an aversion to wallowing or feeling, we're like,  Nope, I don't need to, you know, I'm just gonna, again, white knuckle my way through something.And what we find is that grieving is so important for us to allow ourselves to come into contact with the emotion that is there, what was lost. The sadness that is held around what those experiences might have been like and to allow ourselves to come into contact with the pain. And then the fourth step is pivoting. I don't believe that we pivot before we witness and grieve. You know, I think that the pivot, right, which is about, I don't know if you've ever done cross-country skiing.",
        "Vienna: Okay. ",
        "Vienna: Yeah, makes sense. But you know, the idea of, you know, if a track is already laid, ",
        "Vienna: It's so much easier. I mean, it's hard anyway, but it's easier than when you are in fresh  powder. And the pivot is really about, okay, I'm jumping off the thing that is so familiar, the pattern, right? And when I have witnessed and grieved the pause between stimulus and response, right?There's more space for us to connect with that. We see, we are aware of things, and then it's in that moment that we can make a decision about staying in the loop or exiting and trying something different.",
        "Vienna: Right. It is. It is the pathway to our freedom. Right, and, and there's such truth to that.  And you know, certain cliches are cliches ‘cause there's truth to them, right? Like that. The only way out is through. And I think when we build up these muscles of awareness of what's happening in this moment is not just about this moment.What's happening in this moment is every moment that predates this moment that is familiar to what's playing out here. When we tend to that. Then pain is like, okay, like, almost as if you could make pain or your wounds a different entity, externalize it, put it outside of you for a moment. Pain is not out to destroy us.They're not like, ha ha, ha, ha, I can't wait to fuck your life ove– you know, it's like, that's not what it's trying to do. It's there to be tended to. It wants acknowledgement, it wants to be seen, it wants to be heard, it wants to be honored, and that's not what we do. We just try to go on with our lives, skip over it, or we don't tend to it properly.And that's the beauty is that, once we do, then pain is able to say, okay, I don't need to keep bringing you back into this. That's why we wind up in the same patterns over and over again. Pain's like, I have to find clever ways to keep bringing you back into contact with this thing. So I'm gonna find ways to do that.",
        "Vienna: There is something so profound about watching it play out and having people care for  the pain and remember it. You know, like, it doesn't just go out of sight and it doesn't mean that you come to some, you know, completion place or you know, you never come into contact with the pain again, we know that grief is an ongoing thing and we will face it every time it presents itself, and it's more that the charge changes, right? That the charge lessens. And when the charge lessens, we have more control. We have more agency as opposed to the pain having more control.",
        "Vienna: Okay. ",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm. Yeah, you know… that question in and of itself, outsources the answer. ",
        "Vienna: You are asking somebody outside of you to make that decision, and I know that you're  asking this for the general public, but I think that that's what people do, right, is they say, how will I know? instead of going inwards and spending time with all of the parts and the pieces that are specific to that individual and that relationship because how one person knows is entirely different than how another person knows.And I think a lot of times it's so hard to be responsible for that decision. There's something nice about somebody else telling us that, like, yeah, well if they do X, Y, and Z, then you should definitely leave. To actually own the decision based on what is true about your life and what's true about what's playing out in your relationship…It's not a cop out, my answer. It's not a cop out, I promise, but I, that's where I would turn somebody for us to then begin to have the conversations of what is happening in that person's internal world and story.",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Vienna: Absolutely. You know, I get a lot of questions about, well, what if, what if a partner  doesn't want to look at their origin wounds or they like, definitely don't wanna talk about their family? And in the best case scenario we have people who do. That's our best case scenario is that people are like, gimme this book, pull up my sleeves, let's get into it. But we can affect a lot on our own, right? You can never make the horse drink from the well. You cannot force a person into this space, and I would not recommend that. But what I would recommend is doing your own. Sometimes we start living by example. Sometimes we start revealing, oh my gosh, I just had this aha, and what this revealed to me is X, Y, and Z.Those things can sometimes shift a system in pretty significant ways, and when you stay on your own path there's clarity that will come from that.",
        "Vienna: Thank you. ",
        "Yeah, thanks. I’m looking forward to this. ",
        "Matt: Oh, hey, listen. I love the guy also. I mean, I sometimes get annoyed emails from people  being like, why are you attacking such a great thinker? Why are you trying to cancel Nietzsche? I, I'm not trying to cancel Nietzsche at all. I started reading him when I must have been like, 17 or 18 years old. I was raised Roman Catholic going through the very cliched crisis, and I just thought his work was electrifying.Right? Changed my life in a lot of ways.",
        "Matt: Oh, a hundred percent. ",
        "Matt: Oh no, it was well underway at that point. I mean, part of it was prompted by politics  because a lot of the Catholics that I knew and grew up with were very conservative. Quite a few of them were very homophobic, uh, which I didn't like at all. Uh, but you know, part of it was just also metaphysical. Like, I started asking questions like, well, does God actually exist?If God exists, you know, what form does he take? If there is no God, what does that say? And you know, I didn't know shit about anything at that point, so I just did the typical thing, which is go on the early internet, you know, this is just around when Wikipedia is coming up, being like, who answers these kinds of questions?And they're like, oh, there's this guy. Write a book called Beyond Good and Evil and The Antichrist. And so I went out to the store. The nice thing about Nietzsche too is because he's so popular, you can get him at any bookstore, right? So I just picked up, I have the same copy actually, Beyond Good and Evil, Twilight of the Idols, and The Antichrist for Penguin and uh, like you, it just rocked my world, right?Like I'd never thought about things like that before. I didn't understand everything. You know, I was 18 years old, but there was this real sense that there was something important going on that was opening my eyes to ways of looking at things that I had never even considered before. So I'm very grateful for that.But like a lot of people, he would sometimes say these things about slaves and women and lower cultures and your eyes just kind of drift over that and you don't really pay too much attention to it. And you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that we do need to pay attention to that kind of stuff. So it's been a learning process for me also.",
        "Matt: And you're like, uh, I'm not really sure that I, uh, can get on board with that one. ",
        "Matt: It's a history of right wing thought, generally, he figures largely in it though. I think actually  he has four whole sections dedicated to him –  more than almost everybody else.",
        "Matt: Well, I think there are two reasons. One good and one bad. The good reason is like you, I  think that Nietzsche offers a profound diagnosis of the problems of modernity that anyone can profitably learn from, including wherever you stand on the political spectrum. And we can talk a lot about what I think Nietzsche offers as a kind of positive program for our progressive or liberal thinkers going forward.But the bad reason is, that for a long time, uh, it was expected that Nietzsche really just didn't even have a politics, or if he did that, it was a pretty minor aspect of his thinking. What we've seen is, of course, that he does have a politics, uh, and it's an extremely right wing politics. And understanding that it not only helps us gain a better appreciation of his own thought, but it allows us to see how it is that he's influenced generations of right and hard right thinkers, including many who are very active today.",
        "Matt: My friend Hugo Drochon wrote a book called Nietzsche’s Great Politics, and that's actually  a line that comes from Ecce Homo, right? Uh, his autobiography, where Nietzsche actually explicitly says, it's only with me that great politics will finally enter into the world, or will begin again — sometimes it's translated variably.And by great politics he means… war that the earth has never seen before. Quite prophetic, if you think that World War I and World War II were upcoming, right? ",
        "Matt: And this isn't something that he looks upon with exclusively terror; it's something that he is  really anticipating because it will provide a kind of edifying or purifying function over the face of the earth.So it's very hard once you recognize these statements to then go back and say, you know, he was just a bohemian intellectual who was offering critiques of art or psychological advice.",
        "Matt: I think that there are a number of different things to be said about this. Nietzsche, early in  his own career, actually enjoyed tremendous academic prominence, something that people don't know, but as a philologist, right? Um..",
        "Matt: Generally, the study of ancient languages, but really examining the roots of various words  in ancient languages. And this of course contributes to Nietzsche's early interest in things like Greek philosophy. And people thought he was a Wunderkind, somebody who was going to revolutionize the discipline, and great expectations were put on him. And then he releases his, uh, first book, The Birth of Tragedy.And pretty much the whole philological community is like, what is this? Right? This is not philology, this isn't quite philosophy. It's not even art commentary. It's just weird. And his academic position pretty much craters at that point. Undeservedly, ‘cause it's a minor masterpiece, I think. He wrote better books later on, but it's a very interesting text.Then, you know, he spends the rest of his life flirting with a bunch of different movements. Won't get too much into them. He's only really gaining a little tiny little bit of attention near the end of his life, where, in an important correspondence, he's chatting with one of the first lecturers in Denmark who's talking about Nietzsche's work.And this is important because the lecturer says, I think of your philosophy as a kind of aristocratic radicalism. And Nietzsche says, that's exactly right. You know, that's what I'm aiming for. And then of course, after Nietzsche collapsed into madness, He enjoyed this extraordinary intellectual prominence, unfortunately, amongst a lot of the worst kinds of people, particularly on the political right where the Nazis appropriated him and almost transformed them into their philosopher.German imperialists did the same in the First World War where they would hand out copies of Thus Spoke Zarathustra to German soldiers on the front. So then after the First and Second World War, there was a real effort by people like Walter Kaufmann to rehabilitate him, deservedly, right, for English speaking audiences.",
        "Matt: Absolutely. I mean, if you've read a book by Nietzsche, odds are it's the Kauffman  translation and you know, he's a great translator. He also wrote a very good book on Nietzsche as a Psychologist, but that's kind of itself telling because the way that Kaufmann tried to rehabilitate Nietzsche's reputation amongst the Anglosphere especially, was by presenting him as a kind of bohemian existential psychologist who more or less doesn't have any bearing on politics at all.And this was pretty effective in convincing people that they could read Nietzsche safely while not having to align him with these far-right movements that he had once been so associated with.",
        "Matt: Yeah, exactly. He's a little cranky and eccentric around the edges, right? Then starting,  you know, in the 1950s and really climaxing in the sixties and seventies, he's appropriated by generations of French intellectuals, mostly leftists, who find all kinds of interesting stuff to do with his work.So much so that by the 1970s, you even find people like Michel Foucault, just saying, I am a Nietzschean. Right? With a hundred different qualifications to that of course. But this led to the kind of presupposition, even amongst conservative thinkers, that Nietzsche was fundamentally a kind of bohemian liberal, maybe even radical intellectual.And now we've kind of come full circle, uh, since a new generation of right and far-right thinkers have really rediscovered him and reinterpreted him, I think more appropriately as a right-wing thinker. His politics are not Foucault’s politics. Uh, and they're definitely not Kaufmann's kind of soft psychologism. He is very committed to aristocratic radicalism and that’s a pretty nasty thing, especially if you hold to liberal and progressive views like I do.",
        "Matt: One thing that it doesn't mean is that Nietzsche is there to kill God or offer a scholastic  rebuttal of conventional proofs for God's existence, right? What's important when he says, “God is dead and we have killed him,” is that Nietzsche is describing something that has already occurred, even if people aren't really acknowledging it.Or more importantly, even if they're not prepared to deal with the implications of what it is that they've done. So the crisis that he's talking about is really the crisis in European Christianity that he sees as emerging in the middle of the 19th century when the natural sciences, which themselves were an offspring of the Christian worldview, basically killed their father and established a new secular view of the universe. But he is very concerned that it's going to generate many new kinds of outlooks and new kinds of approaches to the world, many of which are going to be sick, unhealthy, and lead people to be profoundly either unhappy or potentially even worse – to seek happiness in the most crass, venal places.",
        "Matt: Oh, absolutely. One of the things that I find frustrating about... say the Richard Dawkins  types. Richard Dawkins famously had a bus that would go around the UK…NEWSMAN: London’s iconic red buses will soon display the message that God does not exist. The plan is to have thirty buses carrying signs that say: There’s probably no God, now stop worrying and enjoy your life. The campaign has the support of prominent atheist Professor Richard Dawkins.DAWKINS: It’s funny, and it gets people to talk about it. It gets people to think.Matt: That's a very crude, simplistic, almost banal atheism. Right? ‘Cause it almost tries to  ignore religion and the history of religion and the way that it contributed to our very basic moral values, and say, Now that we don't believe in God, we'll just carry on like everything was going on before. We'll just take this little bit out of that. Whatever you can say about Nietzsche and his approach to Christianity, he took it extremely seriously. He did not ignore religion. If anything, he was trying to develop what you might call an active atheism or even an active antitheism. There are some remarkable things that come out of his work from that, but it's really a testament to his creativity and honesty that he took this kind of issue as seriously as he did, and really dedicated his life to trying to solve the problems that he thought were thrown up from this.Even if I think, um, most of his solutions were quite repelling.",
        "Matt: Absolutely, right? It implies fundamentally that there's nothing all that significant about  human life. And that consequently any kind of meaning we attribute to it has to be ours for the making. But I think it's also just important to stress that even his approach to antitheism was extraordinarily creative and innovative, and has been of great influence even to theologians going forward.For instance, it can be very tempting to see natural science as kind of the antithesis of Christianity. What's remarkable about Nietzsche is he says that actually, modern science has its basis in this Christian ethic that you must always search after the truth and you must be relentlessly honest in that pursuit, which could also trace back to Plato, for example.And he says, this led to a lethal situation where in one of his most striking comments, he says, one day Christians were compelled to ask the horrifying question, which is to ask the question against themselves, right? Is the Christian ethic about truth that I buy into itself true? And that's where all the kind of problems start to begin, ‘cause this is where you start to see the scientific method, that emerges from this Christian outlook, turn inwards.I don't know whether this is entirely true as a kind of unpacking of the basis of modern science and its association with antitheism, but it's a really striking creative claim. And again, very contrary to cruder atheists like a Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens who just say, you know, science emerged, had nothing to do with religion and then destroyed religion.We don't need it anymore.",
        "Matt: Well, this brings us to the roots of his aristocratic radicalism, and it's a very complicated  question, so I'll try to unpack it as simply as I can. He believes that ultimately the basis of most conventionally egalitarian systems, uh, including liberalism, democracy, and socialism, ultimately is this Christian ethic, right?Think about Thomas Jefferson saying all men are created equal. Didn't really believe that, obviously, ‘cause he had slaves, right? But still a very inspiring statement. Nietzsche says, at its root, this comes from the lie, he calls it, of equality of souls that you find in Christianity, because according to the Christian outlook, all human beings are sinners.All of us are finite, and all of us are equally loved and equally responsible before the throne of God. Once you take that away, what you find is something that looks a lot more like a kind of socially Darwinian universe, where Nietzsche says, of course, there are fundamental inequalities between people, just like there are certain kinds of fundamental inequalities between animals.There are some animals that are brought into the world destined to die because they're too sick and they're not gonna be able to survive. And there's nothing wrong with acknowledging that. It's just a kind of natural fact that we need to learn to accept. And this is again, what's eventually going to lead to his convictions about aristocratic radicalism, which he sees as the necessary substitute for Christian egalitarianism.",
        "Matt: Once you take God away, the notion that human life has any kind of dignity or any kind of  intrinsic value at all, vanishes with it. And Nietzsche is very critical of people, let's say Immanuel Kant who think that you can somehow sectorize a notion of dignity and say that each individual life has an intrinsic worth, even if we don't necessarily buy into God and he thinks this is why Kant, for example, needs to bring God back in, even after his critical thought had destroyed the possibility of proving God's existence, uh, cuz it's so important morally. Uh, and again, he says, once you deny the idea that life has any intrinsic value, let alone that each person's life is of equal value relative to everyone else's, this much more competitive, diverse, uh, and quite frankly, brutal world, where you have to will value to your life, into being, through your own efforts.",
        "Matt: It's quite startling. He does predict a lot of things that have a very clear coincidence with  different subgroups and subcultures that we see today. So for instance, he says, one of the things that I'm concerned with is that people are going to give into a kind of passive nihilism where they're gonna assume there's really no point to my life. So the only thing that's worth pursuing is a kind of hedonic pleasure. And so they're gonna dedicate themselves to drugs and alcohol and opiates, to dull the pain, uh, of not having any kind of meaning to their life. And Nietzsche is very contemptuous of this, in a way that I think is deeply unfair.Another kind of nihilism that he thinks is going to emerge – very interesting – is this strong commitment to scientific realism, because he says what you see when people describe themselves as realist is a re-articulation of the idea that knowledge has some kind of worth for its own sake, and the fact that I have a lot of knowledge and see the world the way that it is without judging it, without evaluating it, gives me a kind of purity.  But the other more important predictions he makes is that there'll actually be very active kinds of nihilism or active responses to nihilism that will emerge.Some of these more active forms of nihilism will be people who just enjoy destruction for its own sake. Wanna take revenge against the world on the basis of their feelings of profound resentment and alienation. Other groups he thinks will be unwilling to accept the full implication of the death of God. And what's gonna be interesting about them is he says they will try to produce utopias on earth. That essentially they'll say, We no longer have a kind of heaven that will guarantee us bliss in the future, but we are still committed to this Christian ethic of everyone achieving redemption and happiness, but we need to achieve it in the world here and now.In one of his most remarkable formulations, he says, the truest forms of Christianity that are available right now are liberalism, utilitarianism, democracy, and especially socialism. ‘Cause all of these people are committed to this idea that we can carry on Christian morality, but we're just going to try to achieve a more happy, equal dignified society in this life now. And he thinks again that that's contemptuous, ‘cause it's not fully dealing with the implications of the death of God and… he wanted to smash it.music Human beings seem naturally inclined toward religion.So.. what happens to our religious impulses… after the death of God?That’s coming up… after a short break.MIDROLL 1",
        "Matt: I think Nietzsche himself had complicated feelings about this, as he did about everything.  At points in his writing, he does seem to be attracted to this kind of aesthetic idea of being a philosopher, right? Somebody who apprehends the world the way that it is, without illusions, without faith, without any kind of ulterior convictions being brought to bear on it.But more often than not, I think you're absolutely right that he says, human beings actually cannot live like that, right? We cannot live according to this aesthetic outlook. We need to put our faith in something. And Nietzsche himself was one of the great secular mythmakers of all time. I mean his chief work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, is essentially a prophesizing of the appearance of the Superman or the Overman who's going to redeem the history of humankind because when he arrives, he's going to will great projects that will provide a sense of meaning and vindication to human life. So he set himself a task in some ways that no one could possibly achieve. He wanted simultaneously to be honest enough to reject any potential mythmaking that wasn't firmly grounded in reality, while at the same time being sufficiently honest to recognize that no human being including himself could possibly live with that.A lot of the interesting dynamics of his texts come from the clash between these competing impulses I think.",
        "Matt: I'm not sure he knew what the Übermensch was for him. Uh, at points he suggests, I am  not an Übermensch and any Übermensch is gonna be necessarily stronger than me. So he is not gonna look like what I project onto him cuz he is gonna will his own identity into being. But at other points he has a kind of formula for the Übermensch.And this is actually something that goes back to his early work on the birth of tragedy, where, one of the things that he points out is that with the elevation of the Christian egalitarian ethic, you see the diminution of heroic values of the sort that you saw in Homeric poems, where, if you think about somebody like Achilles, Achilles doesn't feel guilt over the massacres that he conducts. If anything, he sees his capacity to inflict violence as a testament to his strength, and as a sign that he's going to achieve immortality. And Nietzsche really admires this, to a certain extent, right, where he says, there is a vital, powerful, proud individual who doesn't allow the mass, who looks upon him as a frightening figure, to diminish his near divinity.At the same time, Nietzsche also points out, uh, Achilles is kind of a dumb ass, is the only way to describe it. He has two modes of apprehension, either, you know, come at me, bro, or I'm the biggest and the strongest, and you're all gonna bow before me. And he does at points say that one of the things that Christianity accomplished was a deepening of the human soul through the inventions of things like guilt, through the invention of something like a conscience.And even though this had the effect of undermining these, kind of, vital, heroic characteristics, he still wants to keep a little bit of that in his new Übermensch. One of the descriptions he gives of him is he would be a kind of Caesar with the soul of Christ, uh, which is a remarkably paradoxical formulation.But I think you can kind of get the idea, right? It's somebody who's going to be thoughtful and reflective about the world in a way that somebody like Achilles just never is. But he's still going to embody these kinds of heroic, confident characteristics. And a lot of people have tried to pinpoint somebody who seems to match this configuration. Uh… but I don't think that anybody who had emerged in the 20th century who quite met it to his satisfaction, so they, not all the people like Hitler who claim to be a figure like this.",
        "Matt: Oh yeah. ",
        "Matt: Nietzsche often thought that having a great opponent who was worthy of you would of  course compel you to become stronger, and it's very clear in The Antichrist, his best book on the subject. Christ was the one opponent he thought was worthy of him. Sometimes Socrates also gets thrown in there, but by, you know, his very late life, he was even signing his letters: The Antichrist.” About as megalomaniacal as you can possibly get, right? But I think that you're absolutely right that he sees Christ as doing something that is genuinely awe-inspiring, which is to create a world-historical faith that endures over the course of 2000 years. And one of the reasons he says Christ was able to do that, of course, is because Jesus was willing to commit a supreme act of sacrifice in order to live according to his value system. He died on the cross for humanity, right? Compared to him, most other Christians are kind of a pale imitation, since how many Christians do you know who would actually be willing to lay down their life for another, the way that Jesus calls upon them to do.",
        "Matt: Exactly. Right? I sometimes think it's a shame, uh, in a ulterior universe, Nietzsche  actually reads Søren Kierkegaard, who he was planning on reading before he fell into madness, ‘cause Kierkegaard himself had very similar views of Christianity near the end of his life. He would point out things like, listen, there's a fundamental difference between Christianity and Christendom – this kind of conservative nationalist outlook that reduces religion down to being essentially a social glue that allows people to live more easily. I think Nietzsche would've found a kind of kinship with this view.",
        "Matt: Oh yeah. ",
        "Matt: First off, I just wanna say that I think that Nietzsche is the greatest reactionary thinker of  all time, maybe rivaled only by Dostoevsky, but what's interesting about Nietzsche is, and Losurdo points this out in his book, earlier kinds of conservatives were really committed to this idea that what we need in order to support a hierarchal worldview is more religion. Because religion serves as a kind of social conservative glue that also sublimates human hierarchies in important ways.So you see people like Joseph de Maistre, for instance, characterizing the French Revolution as a fundamentally satanic enterprise. It's actually the term he uses in his Considerations on France. Nietzsche has no truck with that. Nietzsche says, actually, and this is what's so remarkable, the French revolutionaries were absolutely Christian in their orientation.If anything, they took Christianity far more seriously because they really believe in human equality, human dignity, and human freedom for the herd, whereas these kind of crass social conservatives who think that you can use Christianity just aren't brave enough to interrogate their own worldviews sufficiently, uh, and Nietzsche is. And he says at the root of the French Revolution, socialism, liberalism, and democracy, is this Christian idea that all human souls are equal and that we should try to create a humane beatific world where the criteria of justice is how well is your society doing for the least among us.And he says, I reject that emphatically. So we need to get rid of all these secular forms of Christianity, particularly socialism, but liberalism and democracy also need to go hard and we need to replace it with this system of aristocratic radicalism that is deeply committed to inequality at its very core.",
        "Matt: Oh no.  ",
        "Matt: Absolutely, right? Uh, he thinks that what you're going to see in a democratic society, let  alone a liberal or socialist society, is a leveling, uh, of all higher values and a reduction of all human beings to the most animalistic level, where the kind of politics that people will be concerned about is how do we redistribute food to the poor more effectively?How do we show greater compassion to human weakness and disability? You know, he would look at the kind of woke activists, uh, that people like Jordan Peterson hate so much and say these are the most Christian individuals in society right now. Way more Christian in many respects than the social conservatives who claim allegiance to this faith, ‘cause they really believe in catering and placating human weakness.He doesn't want any of that. What he wants, again, is an aristocratic radical society where the lower orders can be used even as slaves, and he's not afraid of that term, for the projects of these truly great individuals. And the reason for this is he thinks that some people are just herds, right? Uh, animals.They don't really contribute that much to life. They're gonna go about their merry little way, and if you give them too much power, they're going to drag the truly great amongst us down. So why let them? Why not reduce them to the level of slavery, and allow the great individuals out there, the Napoleons or whatever, to get on with the project of producing genuinely edifying enterprises in human life.",
        "Matt: Well, I don't think that he actually provides a lot of arguments for this. Now, to be fair to  him, he does point out that a lot of egalitarians just treat the equality of souls as an axiomatic truth, right? It's just something that's obvious and that we start our moral musings from. And I don't know that that is true.I think that you need to develop a theory of equality that defends it comprehensively from a philosophical or theological perspective, and many of us don't bother to do that. Uh, and we should. On his front though, arguing that there is a fundamental inequality of the souls, I don't think he ever really provides compelling arguments for that, and I'm not sure that he's really confident about that. Precisely because he keeps flipping through the deck, if you wanna call it that, looking for the kind of right argument that will knock down, prove his point. So sometimes he'll say things like, look what I mean by an inequality of the souls... it's just the kind of Darwinian inequality that you see in nature, right? Where, yeah, the lambs look upon the eagles and they think that eagle is a really monstrous figure because it is strong and it is dangerous, And Nietzsche says, no, you know, the bird is just hungry. It probably doesn't even think about the lambs. It just looks upon them as a kind of tasty snack, and almost has a bit of love for them in that respect.And I don't think that that's all that convincing, uh, not least of which, because from a purely Darwinian standpoint, cockroaches are the most evolved species, right? Because they'll fucking survive. And I don't think that Nietzsche’s saying, be more like the cockroach, right? That is the more evolved sensibility.At other points, he tends to align it with a kind of health, psychological health, or even physical health. He says, look, just like there are healthier bodies and stronger bodies, so too are there healthier and stronger minds. He never really provides that much of a template for this, uh, but there's a kind of I know it when I see it mentality.And… again, I'm just not really sure that I buy this idea that people who are psychologically more healthy are necessarily better than others? I'm not even sure how one would actually define that, especially because a lot of great people, including Nietzsche, seem psychologically very fucking unhealthy, let's put it that way, right? If anything, their deep deficiencies as individuals and their profound anxieties seems to be a catalyst for them engaging in these grand enterprises.Again, is that self-evident? I don't think so. ",
        "Matt: But, it's a remarkably creative kind of interpretation. And I think that what's important  about this is it does put pressure, theoretical pressure, on people like myself who are democratic socialists, to defend quality on a more theoretically sophisticated basis, rather than just treating it as axiomatically obvious that either people are equal, or that everybody is going to accept that people are equal.music What would you say is the defining belief of political right? Is it a defense of tradition? A devotion to the past? Matt’s gonna tell us what he thinks… after one last quick break.MIDROLL 2Music",
        "Matt: Well, the political right has never actually been that committed to maintaining tradition.  The way I define the political right is in terms of its commitments to inequality. I think that F.A. Hayek is absolutely right, that to be on the political right means that you believe there are demonstrably superior people in society and they're entitled to higher status, higher political influence, and more wealth if you're kind of crude. Ever since liberal and egalitarian movements have gained hegemony over much of the world, the effort has always been to try to push back against them, which is necessarily gonna entail transformative change of a certain type. And this is true of even people who will label themselves traditionalists of a certain sort. Think about somebody like Ronald Reagan in this country, right? Ronald Reagan instituted some of the most profound transformations in the United States since FDR.Now, I think Reagan trains the country very much for the worse. And it's worth noting that, in the so-called land of the free that he constantly talked about, there were more people in jail in the USA by 1991 than there were in the Soviet Union, the so-called evil empire. Or even think about somebody like Margaret Thatcher, right? Margaret Thatcher presented herself as a conservative and enacted a revolutionary set of changes that were consciously intended to profoundly reformat British society. So even these traditionalist figures are not comfortable with retaining forms of egalitarian institutions that they don't want, and they're very happy to reconstruct them or even get rid of them if that's what's necessary, even if they've been around for decades.You know a really telling example of this also is, uh, William Buckley. I'm sure you know Buckley, right?",
        "Matt: He used to go on campus tours and a bunch of know-it-all professors and eggheads like  me would sometimes sit there and be like, you know, Buckley, like you're all about conserving and preserving and tradition and all that stuff. But what about like FDR's welfare state? Isn't that part of the American consensus? And shouldn't you be committed to conserving that? And every single time they said that, he laughed in their face, saying, I am not interested in conserving that at all. We have to get rid of it, and if that means big transformations, then so be it. Right? So the way that this aligns with Nietzsche is that he is very much in keeping with this attitude towards change that you see on the part of the political right, but he wants to go further than any of them are usually willing to go. For many on the political right, the ambition is to kind of turn back the clock on liberal secularism and move back to this more Christian model of hierarchical complementarity where there will be social stratification. It'll be justified according to a religious basis, uh, and… we'll all get along. Nietzsche says, actually the problem is that Christianity is at the base of all these egalitarian movements. Any kind of religion that emerges will probably also have the same propensities inherent within it.So what we need to do is actually commit ourselves to a kind of militant secularism, because only once we become secularists that we can realize that Darwin is right, that there are fundamental inequalities between people, and that those should be reflected in society.",
        "Matt: Oh, absolutely. Right? I'll give two examples. Nietzsche would look at people like, say  Jordan Peterson or Dinesh D’Souza, both claim to like Nietzsche and also wanted to defend Christian civilization. And he'd say, uh, you people may claim to believe in the Christian God, but you certainly don't like his message at all. You wanna reject his message as emphatically as you possibly can. By contrast, all those woke secularists that you constantly rail against might not even believe in the Christian God anymore, but boy oh boy, do they love his message. They absolutely agree as Frantz Fanon once put it, that the wretched of the earth have God on their side and will one day triumph, and should triumph, right?So, think about Dinesh D’Souza's recent book, United States of Socialism. He is very contemptuous of people like Bernie Sanders for undermining a kind of religious conviction that he thinks is essential to holding the United States together.But at the same time, he will directly appeal to Nietzsche to criticize things like the Scandinavian social democracies by saying even if a kind of social democracy could work, as it seems to there, why would we want to do that? That's a society he says, of last men, in the way that Nietzsche describes, where they are concerned for the least amongst them. They don't commit themselves to any kind of great projects. I want none of that. And this remarkable tension is never reconciled in his book. Jordan Peterson is even worse in a lot of senses, where, on the one hand, he will sit there and constantly appeal to Nietzsche, describing how this death of God has led to the birth of all kinds of secular totalitarian ideologies like communism or Marxism, while never taking on board Nietzsche’s fundamental point that communism isn't antithetical to Christianity; communism was Christianity. It's the herd gaining control of the house, and doing what they inevitably were going to do, which is level it.",
        "Matt: Yeah, I would absolutely agree with that. The most important Christian figure in American  history is I think inarguably M.L.K, right? And M.L.K. was a radical in almost every respect. He wanted a very pronounced form of economic democracy, in addition to the elimination of all forms of racial hierarchization.And he argued for that on a Christian basis, uh, I think correctly. And Nietzsche would've had nothing but contempt for someone like M.L.K., but at least he would've said, he really gets it. He understands what this message is about. It's about empowering the lower orders of society to strike back against the elites.And I think that the left is mistaken if it assumes that there isn't a kind of power to this Christian ethic that it could mobilize on behalf of more progressive causes than it traditionally has been used for.",
        "Matt: I mean, think of somebody like Paul Joseph Watson, who once said conservatism is the  new counterculture.",
        "Matt: The very same. ",
        "Matt: You know, and I was pissed off at that because he says he likes things like Nirvana and  punk. I'm like, you know, I don't know that defending the cops is all that punk buddy, but we'll put that aside for now.I think that that's absolutely true. And I think this tells us something important about Nietzsche. Nietzsche's worry, really, was that even though God was dead and we should commit ourselves to this aristocratically radical vision of the world, that was not what was going to happen.Uh, instead the herd would continue to triumph and various forms of secularized, Christian doctrines would become evermore hegemonic. And this would lead to a leveling of all higher values and the entrenchment of a very kind of nihilistic outlook over the world. And if you view these kinds of ideas as hegemonic, culturally, the way that you just described, you can understand why you could turn to Nietzsche as a kind of countercultural figure, and present yourself as a kind of right wing punk, or right wing countercultural figure. Now I think a lot of this is done in bad faith and it's extremely crude. Uh, and we can talk about how the right misappropriates Nietzsche, uh, but there is a kind of affinity there to his work that we shouldn't deny.",
        "Matt: Richard Evans in his Third Reich trilogy points out that Nietzsche had a profound  influence on fascism. And this is something that has been better understood by historians than by philosophers. You know, we like Nietzsche and we wanna read him. And the idea that he was aligned with the most sinister movement of all time and profoundly influenced them is a deeply discomforting thought.",
        "Matt: But it is something that should give us pause because I think that Nietzsche was not a  fascist thinker in some respects. But he definitely provides ammunition for far right movements, very overtly in many other respects. He wasn't a far right thinker in the sense that he was deeply contemptuous of nationalism, which was just another herd morality that was emerging by weak people, because they weren't able to will their own destiny as individuals. They needed to kind of project it onto this collective identity that would then be the standard bearer for great politics going forward. Uh, and some of the things that I admire about Nietzsche, is just how much fun he'll poke at things like antisemitism, German nationalism… So in these respects, we can criticize the far right for its appropriation of Nietzsche since it almost invariably turns in this kind of nationalist identitarian, racist direction. On the other hand, there is no denying that a person, again, who says we should train a group of slaves that will be at the service of the truly great people who will demonstrate their arrival through great politics of violence: that can be very conducive, to a kind of far right, alt right politics, and most of the people who've taken up his mantle, people like Richard Spencer, are inconsistent.But they're not wrong to assume that Nietzsche provides a license for violence, exploitation, slavery, radical forms of inequality. Uh, and I think that we need to be attentive to that in a way that we haven't been in the past.",
        "Matt: Whenever somebody puts down on pen and paper that we should have an aristocratic  and highly elitist society, it's a pretty good bet that they think they're gonna be part of that elite, right?",
        "Matt: And, the problem with texts like this is of course, it invites readers who are sympathetic to  the text to imagine that they will also be part of that elite.Like, you very rarely will find Ayn Rand fanatics who will sit there and say, I'm not John Galt. I'm one of the second-handers. Same is true. You very rarely find people who read Nietzsche's politics, sympathetically imagining while I am part of that herd and I will be the slave. And that's all well and good, right?But I think this is where I would offer my own critiques of Nietzsche. And I think we need to be critical of him as a philosopher, in a way that maybe we haven't before. One of the things that's interesting about Nietzsche is he's a profound diagnostician of ressentiment, or resentment, but he only ever locates resentment on the political left, where it's envious people looking up and wanting to bring others down. He very rarely talks about the kind of resentment that can emerge on the political right. Uh, which I think is by far the most potent kind of resentment that you find in politics today.And the resentment that you see emerging on the political right very much is this kind of aristocratic attitude, that, I am entitled to superior status relative to others. And this is being taken away from me by the losers of society. I can't quite understand how, but they keep managing to accomplish that. And I am embittered about that and I will do something about it. Sometimes this can take extraordinarily malicious forms. Probably the worst example of this kind of right wing ressentiment that I found is George Wallace in the 1960s, uh, who was the governor of Alabama. He once said that if the Supreme Court will actually enforce desegregation in schools, then I'll just get rid of all public schools in Alabama. My white children will not go to school with Black children. And if that's the kind of equality that we're going to see, then no one will go to school.And this is just something that Nietzsche never really contemplates. This idea of aristocratic resentment. And I think we need to be much, much more pronounced in diagnosing that in our society right now. The real creatures of spite and malice that exist right now usually aren't people on the political left. There are plenty of them in the Trumpist movement who think that this is their country. They were entitled to it. They're better than others, and they will not allow the losers and immigrants of the world to take it from them.",
        "Matt: Oh yeah, everyone should read him.  ",
        "Matt: I do. Yeah. I mean, look, I teach a class on the political right? And Nietzsche is an  important module on that. And I think that Nietzsche can have a profoundly beneficial effect on students by getting them to ask questions that they didn't before, by instilling in them a deep sense of intellectual honesty, and really just by fostering their creativity, right?I mean, that's something we didn't talk about, but Nietzsche has been a profound influence on all kinds of artists through the 20th and 21st century, most of whom I really admire. People like James Joyce, for example. So if anything, we should be encouraging people to read more of Nietzsche.But we need to also insist that they read him carefully, and recognize that there is a deep politics in his work. It is a politics that is fundamentally contrary to the liberal and egalitarian values on which your society is predicated. And I think that there's a lot of, I'll just use the term evil, in what it is that he's trying to accomplish politically. And we should be critical of that, while also accepting the fact that there are extraordinary gems in that work, as well.",
        "Matt: I mean, along with Marx, he's, um, one of the great diagnosticians of the crisis of  modernity that emerged in the 19th century. And he's indispensable to understanding that.The way that I go about rebutting him is by saying, look, I take seriously this idea that ressentiment can lie at the basis of all human actions.Uh, and I don't think that there's any denying that there's plenty of ressentiment on the left as well. Anyone who sits there and sees those “burn the rich” or “eat the rich” signs can't help but be a little bit worried about that. But I think that progressive causes, unlike what he thinks, actually require quite a bit of strength, creativity, and will to go into them if they're going to be successful. And I think he profoundly underestimated the emotional importance of love as a kind of empowerment, including universal love. Whether you understand that in a Christian, a liberal or a socialist way, that's the kind of emotional basis on which I'd want to ground my politics, not this kind of aristocratically radical sensibility."
