PUBLIC TRANSCRIPT | Rebecca Jennings + Justin Charity |

TITLE: The value of being a “hater”

SUBTITLE: There's power in the subversive, reactionary act of spreading a little target 
negativity on the internet

DESCRIPTION:
Guest host Rebecca Jennings talks with Justin Charity, cultural critic and senior staff writer 
at The Ringer, about what it means to be dubbed a "hater" on the internet. Rebecca and 
Justin talk about the role of criticism and the evolving ways in which critics and fans clash 
online. They discuss how a bad review (or a review seen as bad) can spark a far-ranging 
backlash, how the meme-ified cry of "let people enjoy things" has been taken from its 
original context, and what — if anything — might change the dynamics between fans and 
critics.

TOP:
Hi, I’m Rebecca Jennings, I am a senior culture correspondent at Vox.com, sitting in today for 
Sean Illing.

COLD:

CLIP [Tiktok hater]: This is an agree-to-disagree zone. 
This is Talia Lichtstein. 

CLIP [Tiktok hater]: Don’t try to fight with me, fight with yourself. Don’t give me 
context or excuses. I do not change my mind.

And this is one of her TikToks from last August, in which she’s announcing pretty clearly that 
she… is a hater.

CLIP [Tiktok hater]: Here are some things that I don’t like. People who, instead of 
like clapping with their hands, they clap by like hitting a part of their body… they'll 
like hit their leg. People who text me without getting to the point— text, “hey”. And 
just wait for me to… what, you need to check that I’m here?

She might come across as a little annoyed here, but, I talked to Talia for a piece I wrote 
recently. She’s not trying to be mean. And it’s not just that she’s trying to be funny. She’s doing 
important work.

CLIP [Tiktok hater]: Hate when a bad thing happens to you and people say, “oh 
my god, I can’t even imagine.” That’s literally like the only thing that you can do.

Talia, like all of us who spend too much time online, is surrounded by relentless, uncritical, 
boring… positivity that is sapping all the nuance… and all the complexity… out of online 
discourse.

[QUICK MONTAGE OF POSITIVITY CLIPS:
1: If you wanna start to feel happy, it starts with you wanting to feel happy.
2: If you like this video, give it a thumbs up!
3: I love you guys, give this video a big thumbs up if you enjoyed it.
4: Be positive. Spread kindness. Pay it forward.
5: If you are a positive person, it’s almost your duty to share that shit.]

Influencers love to talk about how they’re “spreading positivity.” They often see any shred of 
criticism directed their way as… hate. Maybe they think, oh this person must be critiquing me 
because they are secretly jealous of my popularity and success. But what’s troubling is … I’m 
seeing symptoms of influencer-brain in… all sorts of people. Not just influencers.

Is there no space for just a liiiittle bit of targeted negativity anymore? Are we heading toward a 
world where no one can criticize anyone or anything without being dismissed as “toxic”?

Keep in mind here – I’m not talking about actual hate, like… the kind directed at entire groups of 
people. And I’m also not talking about the thing that we call “cancel culture,” nor am I 
complaining about “being canceled.” I’m just trying to say…

Might there be some value … in being a hater?

ID: I’m Rebecca Jennings, and this… is The Gray Area.

music 

My guest today is Justin Charity. He’s a senior staff writer and culture critic at The Ringer, and 
he identifies… as a lifelong hater. 

Throughout his career writing and podcasting about movies, video games, and especially music, 
he’s written criticism that seems to say “I get that you all love this thing,” like HBO’s Station 
Eleven… or a Kendrick Lamar album… “but don’t you see that it could have been so much 
better?”

As a critic, Justin’s experienced the backlash of writing a review that’s less than one hundred 
percent positive… and accidentally mobilizing a fan base to all turn against him. 
We talk a little about that experience in this conversation, and we talk about what happened in 
online culture over the past decade or so… that’s made it feel so fringe and risky to be negative.

And I had to start by asking him about this term I’ve been throwing around. How would you 
define … a hater?

music 

Justin: I think somebody who maybe moves through life and culture with a kind of reflexive, 
I, I don't wanna say reflexive, dislike, I don't think that's what hating is ideally about, but 
maybe a reflexive skepticism. Right? Or even a will to roast, to rib. Yeah. Somebody like 
that.
Rebecca: and I feel like the, the value of the hater or the position of the hater in wider 
society has really evolved over time. Like I think we can trace the rise of like optimism in, 
you know, the 2010s as sort of this backlash to like hipsterdom and the poptimism of the 
2000s as a backlash to like the nineties anti-sellout culture.
Where do you think we are right now?
Justin: Well as all things culture, right, we're in the backlash to the backlash, to the 
backlash, to the backlash. 
Rebecca: Exactly. 
Justin: But no, I do think we are currently in a, you know how like Star Wars movies 
sometimes form this arc and people generally recognize that the second movie, the middle 
movie is the dark one. I think we're in the sort of, Backlash to optimism, finally getting a kind 
of full swing to it.
I think sort of bullishness about pop music is still the dominant mode, certainly for like 
mainstream media, right? But I do think that there's a lot of traction for a kind of anti-pop 
sentiment at the moment for sure. 
Rebecca: And hating, I feel like used to be a signal that you were cool, that you were better 
than everybody because you hated a popular thing. Do you think that's kind of still the case 
or like what happened there?
Justin: Well, I don't know, do I? I don't know that I necessarily agree with that. It used to be 
a signal that you were cool for not liking a popular thing. I don't know. I think maybe what I'd 
say is that people used to look at haters in a more ambivalent or neutral way. Like, one 
thing I think about a lot is sort of on the old Chappelle show, they, they had the, the bit 
about the player haters ball, right?
And it's sort of making fun of these guys who all dress like, they're all sort of seventies 
blacksploitation characters and they make a sport right of insulting each other. It's just like, 
who can craft the best insult? Who can be the most consistently negative about everything? 
CLIP [from The Chappelle Show]: The Player Hater’s ball… it was an 
opportunity to hate on a diverse array of mark-ass marks… the most diabolical 
haters this side of the Mississippi…
the difference between then when you could air a sketch like that and there's this sense of 
like, oh, haters, you know, we all have haters in our lives. Haters are fine. I think now the 
hater is somebody that is in. Sort of like the nadir of their regard, right? They're sort of seen 
as like the antagonist of anybody who likes Game of Thrones and Star Wars and Disney, 
and it's just these haters don't want you to have anything, right?
That's the shift, I guess.
Rebecca: so something that I've noticed a lot, and I don't know if you see this in your 
writing about music and entertainment, but I cover a lot of influencers and the main thing 
that I notice about talking to influencers or people that are, you know, not quite famous, but 
getting there or micro famous or niche famous, whatever.
they tend to view the world in very like black and white. There's haters, and then there's 
fans or followers or supporters, whatever. You know, there's no room for like nuanced 
criticism at all because when you hear people shouting at you and shouting their opinions at 
you all the time, or that's at least what it feels like.
The ones that stick out are, you know, the really positive ones. Like, oh my God, I love you, 
I'm obsessed with you. And the really negative ones like, oh my God, kill yourself. Which, 
uh, you know, most people don't feel that strongly about anything or anyone, but I think in 
turn it gives people this kind of brain where they are your enemies and then they're your 
supporters.
And those are the only two kinds of people in the. And I've seen that kind of trickle down to 
regular people too, as we all kind of like are infected with influencer brain. And I'm 
wondering if that's something that you've noticed interviewing famous people or artists or 
things like that.
Justin: What's funny, when I got into music writing, I can think of rappers that I've 
interviewed, but I think rap is different because I think so much of hip hop culture. Or is kind 
of inherently antagonistic where it's almost inherently like what I was describing about the 
player haters ball, right. Kind of the dynamic of just living and being a major player in hip 
hop culture is there are people trying to give you a hard time and it almost actually is a sport 
dealing with haters in hip hop.
That's kind of the joy of a lot of rap records going back to the eighties. Right. Is this sense of 
you being. The underdog, even once you've become the most popular rapper in the genre 
or maybe even on earth, right? That's just what hip hop is. The thing you're describing is 
this fans versus haters dynamic in a more atomic sense, I first encountered on YouTube, 
right?
Like YouTubers were the first people, I remember just constantly kind of talking in this 
gossip level, haters versus fans way. Phenomenon you're identifying, right? A video could 
have a thousand comments on it, but for whatever reason, one negative comment got under 
the YouTuber's skin and then they made a follow up video in response to that.
It's not like human nature has changed or anything. We understand why the YouTuber 
reacts to that negative comment that way. But there is something about the fact, and we're, 
we're writers and we live on the internet in a sense, right? So it's a sense of. Being on the 
internet, you kind of have to manage a personal brand in a way like your, your, your own PR 
department, and that's why you end up internalizing stuff like that so much more than you 
might have if you were, I don't know, a Vanity Fair journalist in 1993.
Rebecca: The dream.
Justin: Yeah.
Rebecca: and I think like as journalists and critics and writers, like, it's kind of our job to do 
that. But also, you know, it is a public facing role where you are online, you are accessible 
for people. When someone has a problem with what you write, you will know about it if they 
have a big enough problem.
But I think as you know, more. People develop followings or even like mini followings. I'm 
shocked at how little fame or notoriety a person can have and start to adopt this way of 
thinking. 
Justin: Yeah.
Rebecca: And again, like I truly think it's human nature. Of course it is. It's all about self-
preservation and it's easier to deal with criticism when you just can like write off the whole 
group of people that have anything negative to say as like a hater.
But at the same time, bringing up YouTubers is such a good point because the key phrase 
there is spreading positivity and spreading negativity. It is. My least favorite thing in the 
entire world, say Jake Paul or something. He's like, I'm just trying to spread positivity, man. 
Why is everyone coming after me?
It's like, cuz you scammed all your 12 year old followers into like buying this fake crypto 
coin. And like probably stole their email addresses for something nefarious. But I'm glad 
that we're seeing a backlash to that because I think that was such a big part of the 2010s 
culture. Whereas like if I'm a woman, that means I'm a girl boss.
And anything a woman does that makes it inherently empowering. Or anytime a YouTuber 
does something shitty, it's like, but I'm just trying to spread positivity.
Justin: Well, I don't, I don't know. I mean, I think in the beginning that kind of spread 
positivity, defense mechanism is understandable, right? Once you realize that you're living 
in a version of the internet where one, you just sort of there constantly. Yeah, you have a 
schedule for releasing videos or uploading tik toks or whatever.
you're just always there. So you gotta find a way to warp reality in such a way, , like you 
have a kind of rationalization of everything that you're doing, and you don't have to sort of 
internalize negative feedback because you just feel like you're being poisoned after a point 
if you just making YouTube all day.
But I really don't think that you can talk YouTubers or others out of this posture yet. And I 
don't, I don't, I don't know how close we are to that. Right. I, I think that's still the default 
tone, the default survival mechanism of someone who has to live on the internet with a huge 
following, where they have to filter out a lot of negative feedback.
Rebecca: I, I remember Taylor Swift's fans had a tantrum because Pitchfork rated her 
album like a 7.0, which is like a pretty decent score. or Mr. Beast getting criticism for, this is 
a very recent example. Um, he made a video. Where it was like, I just cured a thousand 
people of blindness 
CLIP: In this video, we’re curing a thousand people’s blindness! [applause] It’s 
gonna be crazy. Most of us see the world like this. But, here’s the thing… two 
hundred million people see the world… like this.
and people sort of accused him for using disabled people for profit and for like charity porn.
And of course, you know, the Mr. Beast stands and Mr. Beast himself were very frustrated 
by that. And were kind of screaming on the internet about how he can't do anything, right? 
People just wanna hate, he's just trying to spread positivity. Uh, but we've seen like these 
celebr. Having these kind of like tantrums online about not getting exactly the kind of 
reaction that they were intending to or feeling really overly criticized.
I feel like it's never been a worse time to be a critic because we're just so easy to attack for 
being haters.
Justin: I think, I think about a lot. The thing you're saying with, um, you know, what 
happens when your website gives Taylor Swift album a seven, right? And that that's not 
enough for people. You know, some people think that in review websites of all kinds of all 
media in the past 20 years. Right. It's almost like a grade inflation has happened as a result 
of this fan pressure because it's sort of, whether you're talking about a video game or 
whether you're talking about a Taylor Swift album, anything lower than a seven scans as a 
pan to people
Right. And you're right. I think in that sense, you're right. There's never been a worst time to 
be a critic. It's one thing when you do genuinely pan an album and you're like, yeah, I wrote 
that. Knowing. This artist has fans and they're gonna be mad and they're gonna disagree 
with things that I said. But I think the definitive dynamic of our time is you can write 
something positive, but just insufficiently positive and people will, will snap on you,
That's the dynamic. That's the modern dynamic.
Rebecca: Exactly. Or you care so much about Pitchfork that like, that feels like a big 
enough slight to Taylor Swift who is, you know, 20 times the amount of influence that 
Pitchfork does her and you know, Nicki Minaj fans are often cited and.
Justin: I've been there
Rebecca: Have you really? Have you been canceled by Nicki Minaj fans as Barbs?
Justin: No, I've been ca I mean I'm uncancelable, but you know what I mean, right? Like it's 
sort of just as somebody whose like main music criticism, background is rap, there was 
definitely a specific period of a climate of fear around Nikki. It's also like, I haven't been on 
Twitter for years. It's so sort of like without a Twitter account,
Rebecca: You're safe,
Justin: you know, I have fine, but like back then, right.
If you, you know what I mean? If they could touch you, they could touch you, right? 
I don't know. It's almost like there's this balance, right? There's a, there's, in any, any year, 
any decade, there's a certain amount of fan energy in a culture and a certain amount of 
hater energy in a culture. And the, the balance of these things shifts.
And right now we're just sort of, you know, I, I think the past 10 years have been this. High 
point of the saturation of fan energy and low point of the saturation of hater energy, and it's 
almost like the fan contingent in culture know that they have this upper hand and they're 
really reveling in it.
Rebecca: And I think so much of this boils down to this very, very, very popular internet 
meme that is, side note, has been totally divorced from its original context, but it's a web 
comic from a few years ago where someone walks into. a room with a bunch of people 
watching like a football game or something, and the person is kind of like making little jabs 
about like how stupid football is.
And the last frame of the comic is just some guy like shutting his mouth and he's just like, 
shhhh let people enjoy things. And that's obviously the part that has gone Mega, mega, 
mega viral. Where to use a really hacky example like the M C U, the Marvel Cinematic 
Universe. You know, you can tweet something like barely critical of it and someone can 
reply with that image of saying, shhh let people enjoy things.
Like, how dare you. Like as if that's like, you know, this unforgivable crime. Having the 
same energy of walking into a room of football fans and being like, you guys like this. You 
know, those are two completely different things.
Justin: Yeah. And people, I think often treat those responses as mutually exclusive. Right? 
Like the, the thing that's frustrating about the person who's mad about either somebody is 
like, I liked endgame, but I didn't like the specific thing. Or frankly, even the person who's 
like, I didn't like endgame and I don't like the M C U, is that the fan in this scenario?
Internalizes, this idea that they're being talked over or that they're being invalidated or 
obliterated in some way when that moment happens. And I think that's the real problem 
that's emerged in the current fan hater dynamic. 
People really struggle with this idea that, Hey, someone saying somewhere on the internet 
that they don't like something literally doesn't have to have any impact on you whatsoever if 
you don't want it to.
So what's the issue right? 
Rebecca: Right. And I, I talk about this all the time, or I think about it all the time where, 
There is such a difference between the kind of conversations we have or even can have in 
person in social or professional settings and on the internet. So it's like, of course you 
wouldn't walk into a room full of super super M C U nerds and say, actually, I don't really 
like whatever, because you're limited by like time and space and like social norms and 
things like that.
Whereas on the internet it's like, You can go wherever you want. You can find places where 
people are shit talking the M C U, you can find places where people are obsessed with it, 
but like what someone says on your corner of the internet has nothing to do with what's 
happening on the other corner. And the worst part of social media is certain platforms get 
too big and then all those rooms are like shoved into the same one.
And so when you see conversations happening on one side, you take that as like someone 
invading your space where like, it's everyone's space. You know, it's, it's not just yours. We 
don't have the limits of physical space to like keep us all in separate areas. It makes people 
feel attacked when people are just having private conversations or like semi-private.
Justin: But can, can I make a concession or, or ask what you think about a sort of 
counterpoint I’ll offer here, which is that, so if we're talking about the famous comic with the 
panel, let people enjoy things. One thing I sometimes think as somebody who's been a 
hater my whole life is that, okay, those fans, right?
Those fans who overhear somebody being negative about something, somebody having a 
critical opinion about something and internalizing that, right? They have to be reacting to 
something. Something makes me think that at some other point, those people who maybe 
are really invested in Batman comics or Star Wars or something like that, maybe earlier in 
their lives or at a different point in the balance between fan culture and hater culture, they 
felt like there was actually somebody holding the finger of their mouth or they felt that their 
subculture was being held down in some way. It feels like maybe there's a bit of that at play 
where maybe that if haters are being honest with themselves, there was a point in the 
history of these fan hater relations where haters did have more of an upper hand against 
fans, and fans didn't like how haters treated them.
Is there something to that idea?
Rebecca: yeah, totally. I think people carry resentments forever and it can be really difficult 
to separate, you know, your own past experiences with being torn down by someone who 
hates what you have to say and, and not repeating that process over and over again with 
the same kind of dynamic. Like I, I totally understand why people feel so personally 
attacked when something that they love is criticized.
But some people like the critic, uh, Christian Lorenzen. See the power that fans have over 
traditional outlets of criticism as kind of a disaster. Like if the New York Review of books 
starts worrying about backlash to their reviews, then is the act of reviewing itself 
compromised? What do you think about that?
Justin: Yeah, I think absolutely. I do think. Critics have a, like, again, this is sort of a 
manifestation of the problem of how are critics supposed to do their job when there is this, 
this kind of, it feels like it's a little more than soft pressure . I mean, I, the easy response is 
to say, well, the New York Review of books, or The New York Times, or New York maga, 
wherever, or the ringer.
Worry about that or shouldn't care about it or should, should try to keep a level head and 
keep things in perspective whenever Nicki stans, get riled up. about a 6.7 review of a Nicki 
Minaj album, right? And ideally that would be what happens. But even setting aside how 
maybe the executive editor of your website responds to that and sort of counsels you as a 
writer at that website when it's happening, the truth is if you are a writer, that's just not an 
enjoyable experience to go through either, right? So even if the publication will have your 
back, it still feels bad to write something thoughtful but critical about someone or something 
on the internet. and to people to just kinda harass you about it for days, weeks, months, 
maybe even years, right?
Like I've seen that play out in the past decade with people where it's like people will write 
some infamous pan of something and it's just that there's clearly a kind of fan who like 
Chave, , like miserable will like hunt this critic to the ends of the earth for the rest of their 
life. It's the social media part, right?
It's the part where that critic feels like, okay, well, I have to be a brand. I have to attend to a 
brand. I have to be on the internet. I can't just not have a Twitter account, not have X, Y, 
and Z ways that people can sort of get in my dms and my mentions. You kind of want to 
say, well, this is part of the territory of being a writer.
And to an extent it is, but it's also just unpleasant when it reaches a certain level, right? It 
just sucks.
Rebecca: Right. I think there's a sense on, on our end of the industry that like, if you're 
gonna write a pan, it better be worth it. You better be punching up versus punching down, 
which is, you know, a common concept in journalism where, you know, if you wanna be 
really critical of something, think about the power that you as a journalist have over the 
target.
And I, I think anyone can agree that Taylor Swift has more power than me or Vox as a 
whole probably. And so, you know, like any punching up I'm doing, it's like a tiny little poke 
in the universe of feelings. But I think the internet tends to flatten all that. So when people 
see like, Journalist with a blue check writing something negative.
They think that that's like some really powerful person using their enormous power when 
like it's just a person that works at a website that probably is making no money.
Justin: Yeah. You know what's funny too about this is that I, I may be articulating some of 
this as, oh, this is a fact of the internet and how the internet is transformed. But the truth is, I 
remember the internet, of let's say the late two thousands, early 2010s. That's an internet 
where it's sort of, Twitter's been around for a bit.
Facebook's been around for a bit. Social media has been around for a bit. , and yet it still 
felt like in that window you could still do writing where you're disagreeing. You maybe even 
just writing the kind of blog post where it's like you're responding directly to another blogger, 
right? Something like that.
Right. You're writing a pan, you're writing all kinds of critical writing. You're even sometimes 
being super explicitly just spicy. Right? People used to be spicy in the blog era.
Rebecca: Yeah. Oh my gosh. Yes.
Justin: And yet it was still sort of understood that you could have an argument with 
whoever on the internet. Either an artist that you're reviewing album of maybe another 
writer, and at the end of the day, the point is that, well, these are writers.
They're doing the things writers do. They're hashing out ideas. They're having 
disagreements about stuff, and they're adults though, so they should be able to walk it off 
and we can all understand that this is just this is intellectual life. This is intellectual work. 
And I think the thing that's changed, right?
The thing that makes it feel like bad for criticism is the part where people, people don't just 
walk off disagreement now, right? People do the thing where they will camp your mentions 
for the rest of your life. If you cross the wrong line, they will engage you in screenshot 
warfare till the ends of the earth.
Rebecca: this you
Justin: Yeah, this, you, they will, this you like four years after the fact of something they're 
gonna, this you, you, you know, on Twitter, there's been a fundamental breakdown in 
people's ability to process disagreement and just accept that it's natural to disagree. If 
anything like. If you're the kind of person who's sitting on Twitter all day in the first place and 
reading articles, it's because you like being intellectually stimulated and you take as a fact 
that you're gonna encounter a lot of headlines and even whole articles if you actually read 
them that you're gonna disagree with.
But that's part of what you enjoy, that's lost the time. And now you have people who are 
mad and they don't even know why, and they forgot that the whole point of reading other 
people's thoughts and ideas is to encounter other people's thoughts and ideas. And so 
instead they get mad. when they encounter content that is not just sort of reflecting their 
own mindset and biases and priorities back at them, and it's just incredibly strange.
If you remember what the internet and internet writing was like before 2015.
Rebecca: Totally. I see this play out everywhere, whether you're talking about like urban 
planning or Oscar films and it, it feels very like, not to be like all cancel culture or whatever, 
but like when people talk about intellectual ideas or concepts or art, especially, People have 
started to kind of use the language of social justice to bolster their own opinions, making 
you know, your consumption of art or your own like personal philosophies as though that's 
like a moral judgment on your character.
And I find that very fascinating and also very harmful to social justice causes.
Justin: I think on the one hand it's that, right? It's the way that people kind of find social 
justice angles into stories that are not realistically. If like at the level of a genuine political 
emergency, you know what I think about the speaking of 2010s blogging, right? Like I think 
about the boom of the first person essay.
Rebecca: Yeah. Oh my
Justin: One thing that kind of bugged me, and again, remember, I'm a lifelong hater, so 
everything bugs me, but one thing that always bugged me about it is about personal essays 
and how they would sort of be written, not just to be a kind of memoir style writing, but to be 
a kind of way in to maybe an intellectual debate.
Is that like there are definitely strengths to coming at things from a first person perspective, 
but one thing that the first person essay did in the 2010s is it made it hard to disagree with 
people about stuff, right? Because it's one thing if somebody. Some detached, maybe 
voicey, but still third person essay, and you disagree with ideas in it, and you're just like, 
well, I disagreed X, Y, and Z.
But once you revert to first person, You sort of in this weird territory of like, am I gonna 
contradict this person's lived experience? Like are they, if I contradict or dispute something 
in this essay, they're gonna internalize that. Right? That sort of trend line in the 2010s is 
sort of hand in hand with what you're saying about how the moment you decide that 
disagreeing about which film won best Oscar in 2019 isn't just a question of taste, but it's 
also about the future of race relations in the United States. You've escalated this potential 
disagreement up to 11, and it's sort of like one by doing that, right, you've made it harder for 
people to even want to do it,
Rebecca: Exactly.
Justin: the people who do want to throw down about it are gonna be people who are 
already at 11, right?
And are gonna wanna , you know.
Rebecca: way of putting it,
Justin: Like that ends up being, the problem with it is that you really screen out a lot of 
more sort of, I think, nuanced conversation with a lot of how these dynamics have taken 
shape over the past 10 years or so.

We’ll be back with more of my conversation with Justin Charity… after a 
quick break.

Rebecca: So I actually had this really interesting conversation in an article that I wrote 
recently. It was. In defensive haters. Um, she is Talia Lichtstein. She's a TikToker. She's in 
like an her early twenties living in New York. She's very much like N yc TikTok, girly, but her 
kind of self branding is like spread negativity with a heart emoji, and she's actually a really 
smart, really lovely, not like this mean, nasty person.
But her whole thing is that we've lived on the internet where everyone just says that they're 
spreading positivity regardless of what they're doing. Everyone has to love everything. And 
her thing is she, you know, she just does videos about like, what I hate. And a lot of it is, 
you know, like anti-feminist stuff, like Andrew Tate.
A lot of it is just like, I hate when like couples do this thing on Instagram and I think that stuff 
is so fun and we need more room for just like mild social critique, which I, again, like this is 
what artists do, but she was saying how so much of the internet is, is kind of divided into in 
between like, you know, haters and fans.
She was like, I think there's some power in just being like, well, yeah, I'm a hater, but like, 
I'm also like injecting nuance into this conversation that was never there before. And if you 
wanna call me a hater, like that's fine too. I'll call myself that. Um, and wear it proudly.
Justin: That's, that's, it's honestly refreshing.
Rebecca: Yeah. I think they're learning. I think the kids are
Justin: But but part of it too, right? It's sort of okay leaning into being a hater, right? Like 
trying to be a part of the counter reaction against positivity culture. It's like, I feel like what 
we're really ultimately talking about is at some point, some sizable contingent of the internet 
decided that almost all disagreement is catastrophic.
Almost all dissent is catastrophic. And being a hater kind of in the attitude of the person you 
just described is not about saying the fan outlook on culture is wrong, and the hater outlook 
is right. To me, it's more about a mindset of like, I'm a hater. It's fine. Like this doesn't have 
to be a catastrophe.
Like it's also fine that you are a fan and sometimes it can be interesting and fun when fans 
and haters come into interactions with each other and trade ideas and leave different 
impressions on third party observers who maybe don't identify as fans or haters, but maybe 
you learn from watching the interaction of a fan object and criticism of that object. 
Rebecca: Yes.
Justin: What I was describing earlier about how even if you're a professional writer and you 
pan something and your editor has your back, but it sucks if you get brigade bandwagon 
and do oblivion by a Stan Army. That environment makes it hard to develop the thick skin 
necessary to just be like, well, whatever, I'm a hater. If that's such a bad word, then 
whatever. I just identify as it. It's harder to do, I feel like than ever before. It has to be that 
this is the hardest time to ever develop that thick skin because you're just so overexposed 
to the backlash to things. But, You kind of just have to do it. Like even if Twitter didn't exist, 
even if Facebook, TikTok didn't exist, like you would wanna be a careful writer who speaks 
with precision and clarity.
But it's a genuinely awful feeling when you catch yourself saying not, oh, I want to tweet. I'm 
saying this because it's maybe not true, or It's not quite how I feel. And instead, you realize 
that the voice in your head isn't even in your own voice. It's like the voice of a disembodied 
tweet yelling at you or something.
Rebecca: Oh my God, it's yes.
Justin: It's humiliating to catch yourself sort of thinking that and sort of realizing that, oh 
wow, my writing really is being in some way puppeteered by a backlash that doesn't even 
exist yet. Right. You don't want that. No one wants that, I don't think, and writing can't live if 
it's gonna be in an environment where writers are constantly thinking that, you know?
Rebecca: I know it's, it's such, my editor and I talk about this a lot. How, like we, yeah. We 
live in fear. Whenever we put up a story, you know, there's, we go through and think about 
everything that could be taken out of context or something that could just be like blown out 
into something that it was never meant to be or didn't include someone's.
Personal perspective, and it's like, no, it's, it's written by me, it's my perspective. And like if a 
writer could just like write everyone's experience at at once, it would be the worst thing 
you've ever read. Like
Justin: Yeah.
Rebecca: just be like absolute garbage. So yeah, I think that's a really great point, how it 
makes worse writing and in less interesting conversations, because I think when people just 
see two extreme sides fighting about something, it makes them less likely to wanna engage 
at all and like less interested in the whole thing.
Justin: Yeah. And it's like the, the less likely to engage part is so important to me because 
what that means is that people encounter a headline, right? Or they encounter an excerpt of 
something and they think they already know, right? They think they already know what you 
said in 2000 words because they read eight words and they've kind of pantomime you into 
existence, right.
As either a fan of something or a hater of something, or a liberal or conservative or 
whatever. Like people just sort of carry these straw men in their pockets. Right? And I think 
that's kind of the other unpleasant thing. It's also behind why if you see a score that's too 
low on a review, you just assume right as the Taylor stan that, oh, this writer is 
disrespecting Taylor. They, they, they hate ta. Why couldn't they get somebody who likes 
the artist? And then meanwhile, the reviewer is someone who loves Taylor Swift
Rebecca: Exactly.
Justin: Or they love Lana Del Rey though, right? They love Kendrick Lamar, and they're 
trying to articulate a hard thought or a series of hard thoughts in their review, but you've just 
dismissed it out of hand because it doesn't say 10 10.
This is the greatest album since sliced bread, right? Like this is so much middle ground 
between being an archetypal hater and an archetypal fan, right? And I don't know how 
much of that is reversible. That's what I wonder…
Rebecca: I know.
Justin: I don't know that there's a specific way you could change Twitter or TikTok that 
would disincentivize the bad things and incentivize the good things.
Rebecca: mmhmm. Right now, it's like whenever there's tension or conflict on one corner of 
the internet, the rest of the internet seizes on it because we love stories about like niche 
conflict. People are just like thirsty for any kind of interesting interpersonal tension. And so 
these things get. So much bigger than they should be.
I read about this a lot when it comes to like canceling normal people. Some random person, 
you know, he ghosted a couple girls and now he's, you know, his life is kind of ruined 
because the entire internet was like, oh, this is interesting, look at how shitty he was. This 
reminds me of like my ex-boyfriend, and so let's like destroy him.
Justin: I feel like that's an artifact of the thing you said at the very top of the discussion, 
right, which is, this is what happens when, you devolve the idea of celebrity all the way 
down to guy making short form videos with no producer in his mom's basement. You know 
what I mean? And so it what it's like everybody internalizes the idea that anybody with more 
than a thousand followers anywhere is interchangeable with Beyonce, or interchangeable 
with like George Bush in terms of their stature.
That's the issue a little bit.
Rebecca: Yeah, because look, ultimately all those people are strangers on a screen and it's 
really hard to separate when you're, you're one person, but all these other people you know, 
seem to be so much more powerful than you.
Justin: Yeah. Mm-hmm. Although I do wanna make one caveat now cause I think you've 
clarified something. when these people do kind of brig or kind of, you know, proactive 
mischaracterization of things they encounter on the internet, like, I don't claim those people, 
right? Like those people aren't being haters. 
Rebecca: Yeah.
Justin: It's tempting to conflate the idea of being a hater with being a person who's like 
angry about stuff.
They, they're not really similar modes at all. Right. Because again, it's like almost, it's a lot 
of the time, like the people you will find the angriest on the internet are angry because they 
like something
Rebecca: Yeah, exactly.
Justin: Neither being a fan nor being a hater requires you to be a nuisance to other people.
Rebecca: Right. I feel like haters are more in the like, all right, I'm gonna opt out of this 
because I don't like it. You know? Hating is just like, that's not for me. I hate it. For me, it's 
fine for you, whatever.
Justin: and it might even rant about it. Right. But it's still different. I've been a hater in 
capacities where I've just been like, I cannot stop talking about how much I dislike this thing, 
but it's still different from being like, I don't like this thing versus I don't like this thing, and 
now I'm going to harass the creator of it forever.
That's the difference.
Rebecca: Do you think being a hater is in some way an act of love because of how much 
kind of time slash attention that you could possibly be throwing it?
Justin: I absolutely do. Especially going back to what I was saying in the beginning about 
how. Coming at it, for instance, from a hip hop perspective, I think definitely a lot of the, the 
kind of encoded antagonism, right? That that emergent artists or really artists at every 
phase of their career have to deal with from gatekeepers, from fans, right?
That sense of steel, sharpen steel and hip hop culture, right? I don't think people would give 
rappers in that culture such a hard time if they didn't love hip hop and if they didn't feel 
defensive of hip hop on some level. Right? Like the people you'll find who will get the, the 
angriest and Aggies and kind of the most.
Hater about hip hop are people who love hip hop and who you would never mistake for 
people who actually secretly don't like hip hop or tuned out of it. Right? So it's absolutely, I 
think the case that like the, the primary motivation of a hater is in fact love and a 
defensiveness and a desire to see a thing be, at least in the hater's estimation, the best 
version of itself.
Rebecca: Here's an example that is extremely close to your life, but a couple years ago, my 
boyfriend wrote an article about the Bill Simmons subreddit and how the entire thing is 
basically devoted to like hating on Bill Simmons, even though like these people listen to him 
every day, for like minimum an hour.
I have to hear Bill Simmons talk in my apartment all the time, and I'm like, you love them?
Justin: It's like the logic of hate reading, right.
Rebecca: Yeah, totally,
Justin: Even as a hater, I think I struggled with hate reading for a long time, cuz to me it's 
hate reading and, and it's associated hate listening, right, is tougher for me because 
sometimes it involves taking a figure that you nominally categorically dislike entirely and still 
being like,
Oh yeah, I've listened to a hundred hours of this podcast that I don't like. And then that's 
when it becomes weird cuz you don't have the thing where it's like, well you like hip hop in 
general and you happen to listen to this bad thing because it's one of many albums. You 
instead, it's like you only listen to this thing or read this byline because you hate this person, 
but you're weirdly like one of their biggest fan.
That's a kind of hating, that is a, that's a kind of hating and that's not my style of hating. 
That's too much.
Rebecca: It kind of reminds me of like the way I engage with Bravo reality television, where 
it's like, I think Andy Cohen is, you know, a, a pretty horrible person and he is done a lot of 
horrible things, but like, will I watch anything he produces? Yes. Will I watch all the reunions 
that he, you know, conducts? Yes.
Because in some ways I do love him, but I think it's, yeah, it's, it's. It's complicated, and I 
think that's what we're all, that's what we're all talking about, how things can be complicated 
and they don't have to be purely hate and purely fan. 
Justin: Let let people complicate things.

with Justin Charity.

Rebecca: So when you were saying, you know, the internet is decided, all dissent is 
catastrophic, do you worry at all about the consequences of this on the internet or offline? 
Like do you think that in the future people will have to sort of rediscover this kind of like 
meaningful non performative dissent? Or is this just like a blip that no one should be 
worrying about at all?
Justin: No, I definitely think people should worry because it, I do think it's possible to 
unlearn, or at least partially unlearn that, hey, the culture of putting ideas into the world and 
refining them and exchanging 'em with other writers, especially in the age of internet, where 
you can do it instead of real time or near real time, like, Yeah, I mean we are watching 
people forget that the point of that is not to play act a sort of real life war , right?
That the idea is that you are actually interested in seeing how ideas play out. Together. I 
don't know. I think there is a real danger of that muscle sort of atrophying, right? Because 
people just don't use it for too long. And I definitely think that insofar as we're talking about 
sine waves or ebbs and flows in culture, I at least have hope that people will sort of come 
around to the idea that the.
Turned up to 11 style of online discourse is like played out a little bit that it's not really 
serving anyone well and it mostly just makes people feel anxious and bad if they spend a lot 
of time on the internet. Like I definitely expect people are learning will learn that lesson. But, 
because I can't even imagine sort of what platforms will emerge and what they'll look like, 
that sort of reimpose or reconstitute the alternative culture of disagreement as something 
that we can all just live with and in fact accept as the whole fact and point of interacting with 
strangers on the internet.
Like I do worry about that cause I just don't know what it looks like. I don't know what the 
future of that looks like.
Rebecca: At a certain point, like, things just become kind of background noise. You know? 
It's like…it used to be that like getting a death threat on Twitter was like, oh my God, that is 
crazy. 
And now it's like, okay, . You know what I
Justin: true. Right?
Rebecca: It's so true. But like, I feel like it'll kind of go that way where it's like, you know, 
you're gonna have the, the people at 11 over. and they're just gonna do their thing and didn 
kind of go on ignoring them. And I really hope that that's where we're going because we're 
at the point where like, yeah, you can kind of ignore a death threat on Twitter.
It's, it's horrible and it sucks, but that's such a small percentage of the human condition and 
like they're just irrelevant. You know? Like I think that we could get to a place where super 
duper extreme or, you know, bizarre takes or pronouncements on social media can just. be 
mass ignored. They don't have to blow up into their own little whole thing where we have to 
like make someone the main character on Twitter because they tweeted something stupid.
They can just be ignored. I hope that's what happens. 
Justin: Yeah, I have that dream. I share that dream with you,
Rebecca: I mean, so one question. We talked a lot about, you know, influencer brain or 
YouTuber brain where you know, you as a creator or an influencer or even just like a person 
online are sort of subject to the whims of what the most amount of people that follow you 
want to see.
Do you ever find yourself having that, um, or do you think the publications you work for feel 
that way? What's your experience with that?
Justin: No. And so like I'm at The Ringer and I feel like I at the Ringer have carved out this 
space, right? Both on the The Ringer website and also on my podcast Sound only. Which I 
do with, um, Micah Peters. I touch a lot of different things. I touch hip hop or like anime or 
video games, and it sort of, it, it, it makes sense.
My byline makes sense to me if to no one else, right? But when I left Twitter, you remember 
the first wave of fake pieces people would write of like, . I quit Twitter for a month and this is 
what I found . Right. And I always felt like the premise of pieces like that were always 
misguided. They always sort of assumed that like, oh, Twitter sucks because you're 
exposed to all this stuff and it's this overload of information and you get mad at other 
people.
And it's like, I think I had this realization at the time of like, oh, that's the trick. Everybody 
thinks that the problem with social media is other people. The problem with social media is 
you. Because the issue is like Twitter is actually a perfectly fine website. If it's a website that 
you can go see a feed.
You know, see what somebody's saying about something. The thing that makes Twitter bad 
is your own timeline, right? It's the, it's the fact that you have the power to post individually, 
right? Like no one's problem on Twitter is other people. Everyone's problem is themselves 
and their capacity to post and to create the thing that becomes their timeline, right?
And so to me, I didn't have any high-minded reason. I just realized that the problem isn't 
other people being mad that you didn't like a Drake album. Right? The problem is that 
you've internalized that so deeply in yourself that that matters. I think once I left Twitter and 
then I left all, I deleted Facebook. I deleted like all my social media at the time, and ever 
since I did that, I. I haven't felt perfectly. I still think that there's a lot of sort of stuff about the 
current sort of web writing that still makes for a bad culture overall.
But I don't know, I think at least deleting my own capacity to post and instead having to 
think in terms of, look, whatever thoughts, feelings, anxieties I have, I gotta work them in my 
byline itself, or I mean offline, right? I just talk to my wife about stuff. But it's sort of, if it's 
germane to the internet, it's germane to the conversation about an artist.
I gotta put it in the piece. It's like, oh yeah, that's why Twitter's bad. It's cuz like you end up 
sort of spilling yourself all over this platform that doesn't pay you. Twitter is like a glorified. 
internship, it's a glorified unpaid internship, right? Like so many, so many people who've 
gotten into journalism in the past decade, like they've had to basically spill themselves, not 
just in the capacity of what it is that they cover, but they've just had to kind of sell their entire 
personal life to a website that does not compensate them in any way.
It doesn't guarantee anything about their career, and I think that's one small step you can 
make that kind of like reduce, but you can't tell that to a YouTuber, right? Because the 
YouTuber's like, no, they're not like someone who's like, well, I have a byline, and then 
Twitter is secondary. It's
Rebecca: This is my entire life.
Justin: I don't know what to tell the person who their primary thing has the comment 
section under it and they can't look away.
I don't know what to tell that person.
Rebecca: Good luck YouTubers, have fun. Figure it out. 
Okay, Justin, this was very fun and I loved this conversation. I am not a hater of this 
conversation at all.
Justin: I loved it too. This was great.
Rebecca: Thank you so much for, for being here.
Justin: Thanks for having me.
