INTRO:
Sean Iling: It’s hard to understand the culture of policing in America.. from the outside…
There’s an informal code among police officers … They call it “the blue wall of silence”... And it’s 
pretty much what it sounds like: an ethos that encourages cops to not talk about what happens 
at work … To protect their own, really…
Lots of people have studied the police — who they are, what they believe in and how they see 
the people they’re meant to protect and serve— but it remains a system filled with problems and 
one that’s opaque if you’re not a cop
That’s an issue for all kinds of reasons … the outrage against cops and the tension between them 
and civilians has been mounting … It hit a breaking point in 2020, as everyone knows...and it’s top of 
mind, once again, following the killing of Tyre Nichols last month in Memphis …
The relationship between the police and citizens is about as strained as it’s ever been – at least 
in my lifetime…
So what can we do about this? How can we fix policing in this country?

ID: I’m Sean Illing, and this is The Gray Area.

My guest today is Rosa Brooks … She’s a law professor at Georgetown University who’s spent 
most of her career in the national security world … But she became a reserve cop with the 
Washington DC Metro Police Department back in 2015…

After graduating from the police academy, Brooks worked part time as a patrol officer from 2016 
to 2020 and eventually wrote a book about her experiences called Tangled Up in Blue: Policing 
the American City…

As we continue to grapple with issues of police brutality and questions about how to reform 
policing in the United States, I wanted to reconnect with Brooks - I interviewed for vox dot com 
back in May 2021, in the aftermath of the Derek Chauvin trial. 

She knows what it’s like to do the work, she also has enough perspective to understand what’s 
broken. 

We started out by talking about what motivated her to become a cop in the first place. 

music 

Rosa Brooks: You know, it was the world's weirdest sabbatical project. I had timed 
everything wrong, so I had just finished a different book when I got a sabbatical and I was 
sort of flailing around looking for things to do, and I had heard about this reserve officers 
program and it had just seemed so strange to me that a big city police department would let 
you volunteer to be a cop, it’s nuts, you know, and send you through the police academy 
and give you a badge and a gun and arrest powers.
And I was so struck by how strange this was and I. You know, I've worked at the sort of 
margins of policing issues at different points in my life, but it's such an opaque culture to 
people who are outside of it. It's not unlike the military, you know, unless you happen to be 
married to a police officer or have someone in your immediate family.
You know, most of us don't know anything about police. We think we do, because we see 
them on TV and we see them on the streets, but we don't really know, well, what are they 
taught? How are they trained? What do they say to themselves when they get up in the 
morning about, you know, what story are they telling themselves about what their job is and 
why they do it?
So it just seemed like an incredible opportunity to be on the inside of this very opaque 
culture.
Sean Iling: I have always been fascinated by how cops conceive of themselves and their 
role, and I want to know what you learned about cops when you became one. You know, 
what does the story cops tell about themselves to themselves?
Rosa: Well, there are several and they, they kind of interlock. One thing I discovered was 
when you ask most police officers why they became police officers, there are two stories 
that you hear over and over and over again. One of those stories is, I or someone very 
close to me was a victim of a serious crime, and I want to protect other people from having 
that happen to them or help them if it happens to them.
So that, that's one story. And the other story you hear over and over is, I was heading in the 
wrong direction. I was going to end up in jail and a police officer took me under his wing or 
cut me a break and gave me some advice, or became a mentor, and it changed my life and 
I want to do that for other people.
And I say that because I think there are people who are bullies, who become cops because 
they want to be bullies with legal authority and a gun. But the vast majority of police officers 
go into the occupation for pretty idealistic reasons, and that's very central to their image of 
themselves. They don't get up thinking I'm one of the bad guys.
They get up thinking, I am one of the good guys. I. In this occupation to protect and help 
people and, and that belief is really quite deep. They then often get very cynical, however, 
as they go through their careers, and partly of course, that's because people don't call 911 
when they're happy. You know, they call 911 when something is really wrong and they're 
angry, they're in crisis. Something terrible has just happened. 
So police see the worst of. over and over and over and again, again, every single day they 
see people at their most horrific, they see people who are drunk. They see parents beating 
their children. They see domestic violence. They see stabbings. They see children who are 
dead of overdoses.
You know, it's just, and they can get very, very cynical and, and it's easy, I think, for them to 
start thinking, I don't know, are these people even worth helping? That attitude can kind of 
invade them. You know, I think there are a couple of other pieces. They get inculcated in 
them at the academy and it stays with them throughout their career as this sense of they're 
in constant danger.
That they live in a society where everybody and their brother has 16 guns between them, 
and any encounter could turn lethal in a millisecond, 
Sean: Yeah
Rosa: and that really affects how they go through the world. That sense of people hate me 
and I'm in constant danger. And then add to that, in the last few years, All of the media 
attention on police killings.
This country has way too many police killings. It's insane. It's terrible. But that being said, 
you know, studies suggest that the vast majority of them will never even point their weapon 
at someone in their entire career. Much less, shoot someone, much less kill someone. And 
so the average police officer tends to feel like I am very misunderstood.
Our occupation's very misunderstood. Everybody thinks we're these brutal thugs. I've never 
killed anybody. I, you know, I never wanna kill anybody. And that sense of being embattled 
and misunderstood. Then also, you know, you get the initial idealism, the cynicism, the fear, 
and the sense of being misunderstood.
Sean: Yeah. We're definitely gonna talk about the training and the mindset and how that is 
woven into the culture. But you do make an important point, and that is just the brute fact 
that being a cop is a really hard job. We gotta figure out how to do it better. But it is a really 
hard job and we're in this moment.
There's a lot of anti-police sentiment… 
Rosa: Yeah. 
Sean: And a lot of distrust towards the police, a lot of which has been. Do cops feel justly, 
villainized at this moment? Because I have to imagine if they do, that very much changes 
the way they see and do their jobs.
Rosa: They don't by and large, I mean, obviously I think it's important to say that cops are 
humans, and they're not homogeneous. I've made some generalizations. They don't apply 
to everybody. But that being said, I think the average cop, it's part of that feeling of being 
misunderstood that the average cop would probably say everybody is blaming all police 
because of a few bad apples.
Most police officers are not gonna go the next step and say, well, you know, maybe there's 
something about systemic racism and our role structurally, which also is part of the problem. 
You know, some do. Some do. Absolutely. You know, I know a lot of police officers who do, 
but I think that next move is not one that comes naturally.
I, you know, I have a lot of police officer friends who are on Facebook and just looking at 
their comments about the killing of Tyree Nichols in Memphis. There's a tremendous 
amount of, those officers should go to jail. How could they have been hired in the first 
place? People like that make it hard for everyone.
They make it hard for us to do our jobs. So very often that's their sense is that most of us 
are good. There are a few bad apples, and they make it hard for everybody else.
Sean: You said something to me last time we spoke and I just wanted to, I wanna read it to 
you if that's okay, and just have you clarify it. And you actually alluded to this a second ago. 
You said quote, “I see two profound truths that are in tension with one another. One is that 
policing in America perpetuates extremely unjust socioeconomic divisions, particularly along 
lines of race and policing in America is stunningly violent compared to policing elsewhere. 
But there's another profound truth, which is that the overwhelming majority of cops will 
never even point their weapon at another person during their entire career, much less shoot 
someone.”
I'd love to hear more about why these truths are in tension and how that complicates our 
broader understanding about policing.
Rosa: I mean most of policing, and this is one of the dirty little secrets of policing, most of 
policing does not involve crime. Most of what most police officers do. Most of the time 
involves responding to people complain because their neighbors party, it's too noisy. There 
are kids hanging out in the back alley and they're scared to go out and put the trash out cuz 
they're worried that these kids might have bad intentions and might attack them or 
something.
They're people who are upset because their neighbors, you know, leaving crack pipes in the 
hallway. Their domestic disputes. Parents are mad that their kids didn't come home on time. 
People are mad that their boyfriend didn’t pay his share of the rent. And it's things like that 
and because we live in a society that has largely abandoned poor communities, and 
particularly poor communities of color, because we live in a society that has radically, 
drastically, embarrassingly, underfunded, every important social service, from education to 
mental health care, to transportation, to job creation, the police are often the only people 
available to call. 
So neighborhoods are overpoliced, partly because they're under everything-elsed, you 
know? And so somebody's in the middle of a crisis, even one of these things that, as I said, 
doesn't involve a crime. And there is one phone number in most American jurisdictions that 
you can pick up and call and someone will show up at your door fairly quickly, and that is 
911, and it's gonna be a police officer.
We don't, at this moment, in most places, have any alternative to that. And so from the 
perspective of a police officer, they can feel like I spend all day, every day trying to help 
people with their ridiculous problems, which are not what I was trained to do. And the good 
ones help with empathy and compassion and concern and, and don't feel aggrieved by it.
The bad ones do feel that's not fair, why should I have to do this? I'm not a social worker, 
I'm not a medic, I'm not a whatever. But either way, police feel like I'm not running around 
looking for people to shoot. That's crazy. On the contrary, I go where I'm told to go, I didn't 
create this system. I didn't decide, hey, let's underfund education or whatever. I didn't 
decide. Let's have these particular rules and regulations. I go where I'm told and where I'm 
told to go is where people in the community call 911 and ask me to go. And so there's that 
sense of feeling misunderstood. And I think the thing about structural racism and economic 
inequality is that it's hard to see.
You know, it's really easy to villainize a person. And it's really hard to villainize 10,000 small 
decisions that cumulatively add up to a situation where people are hopeless and poor and 
have mental health issues that go unresolved for years and years and substance abuse 
issues. And so for police, I think they can start feeling like, what's the matter with these 
people? Why don't they just kind of pull their socks up and get their act together and look at 
all those other people out there, CNN, who think I'm this bad guy when all I do is I spend my 
time cleaning up other people's messes. 
You know, that being said, roughly a thousand people a year are killed by police in the 
United States, some of those killings are, are legally justified. You know, some of those 
really are self-defense or defense of others. Others of those shootings, and probably, 
unfortunately, the majority of them, the vast majority are probably preventable, and some of 
them are straight out homicides by police. But there are 750,000 police officers in the 
country a tiny fraction of them tend to be involved in excessive force cases. And so for most 
police officers, that feels like that's got nothing to do with me. Why don't people like me? 
And it's very hard to see two things, I think one, it's very hard to see that even if it's very 
rare. The way the occupation is structured contributes to that thousand-ish number, and 
that's still a very high number compared to every other country in the world.
But also that it's not just the dead people, you know, it's all the people who get yelled at, 
who get humiliated, who get frisked when they were just mining their own business. It's all 
the people who have a thousand smaller interactions that are painful and remind them of 
inequality.
Sean: I love what you said a minute ago. I just wanna flag it and then we'll, we'll keep on on 
rolling here. People are overpoliced because they're under everything-elsed.
Rosa: Yeah, that's a technical term. The under everything-elsed, that's what we call it in the 
legal academy.
Sean: that captures a lot.
Rosa: This is where this actually intersects with the sort of defund, the police movement. 
Most cops don't want to be defunded, but if you ask a cop, are you the right people to be 
doing A, B, C, D that you spend 75% of your time doing, they would go, of course not, why 
can't the city fund those other things so I don't have to be doing them?
Sean: I do wanna talk about how the profession is structured, though. Of course, there's a 
discussion to be had here about the culture of policing and how it's broken and I think a 
helpful place to start is with the militarization of policing and a lot of the discourse, as you 
know, focuses on the gear and the hardware and the tactics, and that's all worth knowing.
But I know you think the more profound problem here is how police departments are 
organized. Can you say a bit about that?
Rosa: Sure. Yeah. They tend to be hierarchies that are modeled on military command 
structures, you know, so there's a commander, they're captains, they're lieutenants and 
sergeants, and then the lowly patrol officers beneath them, and those commanders are 
themselves in a hierarchy that goes up to assistant chiefs and chiefs and so forth.
So it tends to be a very rigid and hierarchical organizational structure. The training in most 
jurisdictions is kind of like a, a bad caricature of a 1980s marine boot camp. I mean, the 
military boot camps are not as boot campish as many police academies are anymore 
because the military figured out that this is maybe not a great way to train people if you 
want them to be developing critical thinking skills.
Sean: Can you just give a little color there in terms of like, just so people have a visual, like 
when you say they're training like it's 1980s Marine boot camp, is it the weapons they're 
using? What are they actually doing?
Rosa: Well, if anybody saw the movie Full Metal Jacket or things like that where you've got 
the drill surgeon, he's, you know, screaming, you maggots, get down, gimme 50. You know, 
there's a little bit of that. And DC is not, by any stretch, is not by any stretch the worst. In 
fact, it's probably one of the better ones.
You know, it's a relatively progressive police department. But even so, the rules at the 
academy are, you don't, other than to greet people by saying, you know, good morning, sir. 
Good morning, ma'am. Recruits do not speak unless spoken to. If they do something 
wrong, you know their boots aren't shined, right? Or they, they, it's a, you know, often 
punishment based, it's, it's, get down and do more pushups, or you've gotta run around the 
academy five times.
So it's very heavy emphasis on hierarchy, discipline, and punishment. A lot of yelling.
Sean: But, are they playacting soldiers basically when they're going through these 
academies?
Rosa: Yeah, to some extent. And it's certainly, I think it's fair to say that the people who 
become police officers who previously were in the military, often the people who are rolling 
their eyes most at this 
Sean: I bet.
Rosa: And sort of saying, you know, we don't do this in the Marines anymore. This is silly, 
but okay, fine, whatever.
You want me to do more pushups, I'll do more pushups. You know, and needless to say, I, I 
think it's, it's just such a, Terrible message, right? Because the message of being in the 
police academy being told you don't speak until you're spoken to. You say, sir, ma'am, you 
get yelled at a lot, and if you do wrong, you're punished with physical pain, pushups or 
running, or whatever it might be.
That message is that people who have power can inflict pain on people with less power. 
And then if police officers go out into the community and take that message with them, and 
most of them don’t but too many of them do. That translates into a lot of people who they're 
screaming at or shoving and not really caring very much.
And again, I don't think that's true of most police officers, but that's not the same as saying 
it's because they're just a few bad apples. You know, it's not most police officers, cuz luckily 
most people manage to come through that kind of training with more of their humanity 
intact. But, it's a kind of training that could not be better designed to produce people who 
will be abusive towards the general public.
Sean: I think that's right. One of the questions for me is, can cops train like warriors and 
dress like warriors and behave like warriors without thinking like warriors, without thinking of 
themselves as soldiers on a battlefield fighting an enemy?
Rosa: Yeah, well one of the most influential short articles in the policing universe of the last 
20 years or so was a think piece that was done by a woman named Sue Rahr and was 
published initially, I think as a white paper by Harvard's Kennedy School, and Sue Rahr is 
the former commander of the Washington State Police Academy, trained all their state law 
enforcement agents, and she's a former sheriff in Kings County, Washington. So she'd 
spent years as an officer herself, and her paper was called Warriors versus Guardians. And 
she really took issue with this sort of warrior mentality and said, we need to try to 
reconfigure police training and police organizations to get police to think of themselves as 
guardians rather than warriors, and thinking of yourself as a guardian does not mean that 
you don't train in defensive tactics. It does not mean you don't learn how to shoot a gun. It 
does not mean you don't learn how to do those things. But it means that we place much, 
much, much more emphasis on saying to you, you know, those are the absolute last resorts 
and what you should be thinking is that you're out there to be a protector, and every now 
and then a protector will have to use coercive means. But your primary job is to keep people 
safe, ensure people's wellbeing and keep them safe. And I think that that launched a 
conversation within policing that is still going on that's a really important one. And one of the 
points that Sue Rahr makes is that in her program that she ran in Washington State, they 
actually increased the amount of time spent on defensive tactics. And her argument was 
part of the reason that so many police officers pull out their guns is that they're scared.
They don't think they can handle themselves physically and they think they need to pull out 
their gun to even the odds and her take was the more we give them the physical self-
confidence to think I'm okay. You know, I'm not gonna be beaten to a pulp, you know, I can 
handle myself, the less likely they are to panic and pull out that gun.
Sean: Yeah, I mean, you, you talk about this in your book, you know, a lot of police culture 
is built on this myth that the job is extremely dangerous and that. You know, there's no such 
thing as a routine call, right? Like you could be shot and killed at any moment, at any 
random traffic stop. And you, you talk about how that's kind of true and misleading at the 
same time.
It is true in a sense. It is an extremely dangerous job and cops do get shot and and killed. 
But it's also misleading in the sense that that mindset, that cynicism and the kind of 
hardening that it produces, can lead you to perceive danger and aggression preemptively 
where it isn't there, and that can become self-fulfilling and create lethal situations that did 
not have to happen.
Rosa: Absolutely. Yes. Policing is a dangerous job relative to accountants and law 
professors, but it actually doesn't even make the list of the top 10 most dangerous 
occupations in the US.
Sean: That's worth just sitting with. Just for a second. Say that one more time because that 
I think will surprise people.
Rosa: Okay. Policing does not even make the list of the top 10 most dangerous 
occupations in the United States, which are things like being a roofer. It's a really bad idea 
to be a roofer, folks, because people fall off those roofs and they, they die. It's a very 
dangerous occupation. Fishermen, sanitation workers, they're hanging onto the backs of 
trucks, incredibly dangerous jobs.
Policing doesn't make the list of the jobs where you're most likely to die. That said, to be 
fair, the sanitation workers and roofers who die usually aren't shot or stabbed. They're, you 
know, they have accidents, but even when it comes to intentional harm, taxi, limousine, you 
know, Uber drivers are at more than twice the risk of being homicide victims on the job than 
cops.
Sean: Jesus.
Rosa: And yet you don't see a kind of army of we need to have Kevlar vests and AR 
fifteens for all of our Uber drivers cuz it's so dangerous. So it's dangerous, but not nearly as 
dangerous as police officers tend to imagine.
music 

How can we better prepare cops for the realities of police work? I’ll 
ask Rosa Brooks about this… after a quick break.

 

MIDROLL 1

Music

Sean: So is there a better way to prepare cops, to train cops so that they have a healthier, 
safer approach to the job? I imagine part of this story here is how we screen cops before 
they're even hired. And I don't know if the answer is requiring college degrees, although my 
lefty roots will come out here because I, I'm not super comfortable with legislating blue 
collar workers out of any profession…
Rosa: Yeah.
Sean: …but I'm just thinking aloud and throwing it out there.
Rosa: So there are a few studies that do suggest that police with college degrees are less 
likely to be involved in excessive force situations, but it's impossible to untangle that from 
the fact that police with college degrees start out, they're usually a little older than the other 
officers.
Sean: More emotionally mature.
Rosa: Because I think you're right that there are wonderful police officers who don't have 
that formal education because the skills and the judgment really don't have anything to do 
with formal education. They have to do with problem solving abilities and deescalation 
abilities and communication skills. I do think that when one is able to sort of shift the frame 
to guardian, And emphasize to police officers, you know, that is your most fundamental job.
Your job is to try to walk away from every situation, leaving people feeling heard, feeling 
respected, and feeling like they're a little better off than they were when you came into that 
situation. That's your job. And the more academies shift to that kind of a focus, I think the 
better off they are. And again, that's not inconsistent with don't be an idiot.
You know, you don't need to walk alone into a dark alley where you have no idea who's in it. 
You know, it's the same things that we, we all tell, we tell our children, we tell our friends. 
Right. If there is a domestic violence complaint and the dispatcher says that there are 
weapons involved you, maybe you don't walk up the front steps.
Maybe you kind of walk around the house a little bit first and you kind of put your ear to the 
window to see if anybody's shooting before you walk in. You know that there are common 
sense things that absolutely police officers need to practice and learn how to do, because. 
You know, as you said, we live in a gun saturated society.
People shoot each other, they shoot at police officers. You know, you can't discount those 
threats. But at the same time, if you let them dominate, you are going to end up using force. 
A lot of times we don't have to.
Sean: I think a lot of people. May not know this or may be surprised to learn that America's 
actually under policed relative to some European countries like France, say, countries like 
that have more cops per capita, but American cops are more violent. They kill more people. 
And obviously the question is, you know, why is that?
And there are lots of reasons I'm sure, but there is a huge caveat here and you just 
mentioned it, which is that there are more guns than people in America. And that's not true 
in France or anywhere else that I'm aware of. Right? So the whole Second Amendment 
thing does complicate the picture and make the US an outlier case in, in lots of ways.
Rosa: And we also have a legal framework in this country that's extremely permissive 
towards police and that’s part of what makes it very difficult to hold police officers legally 
accountable that the court's jurisprudence very much emphasizes, we don't wanna second 
guess police officers. They have to make split second decisions.
We're going to evaluate the use of force from the perspective of, well, what would a 
reasonable police officer have done in that split second? And so that ends up a contributing 
factor along with their decisions on qualified immunity that make it very hard to hold officers 
accountable. And I, I always tell my students, they say, well, we think police should respect 
people's constitutional rights.
And I tell them, police officers who respect constitutional rights as the Supreme Court has 
interpreted them, can still do a tremendous amount of harm. That constitutional in the US 
framework is not the same as good.
Sean: Could you just say very briefly what qualified immunity means? I mean, obviously 
you're a law professor, so you're equipped to.
Rosa: Qualified immunity is essentially, it's a doctrine created by the courts that basically 
says if somebody's an official, they're an employee of state, local, or federal government, 
and they're acting in their official capacity, that generally speaking, they should be protected 
from being sued civilly for what they did as part of their job.
Of course, then the argument is, well wait a minute, excessive force is not part of anybody's 
job, but the court has the way they have interpreted this. As they've said, yes, officers can 
be sued in their personal capacities, and qualified immunity will not kick in if what the officer 
did violates a quote, clearly established constitutional norm.
but then they go ahead and they define clearly established as meaning that a prior court, in 
a virtually identical case, said that what they did was wrong, which in turn means that you 
get all these situations where a police officer from any kind of common sense perspective 
has done something egregiously clearly wrong, and the court will look at it and they'll say, 
well, we don't see that any previous court said that this was clearly wrong in this identical 
situation.
So therefore, even though we think it was wrong, we don't think it was clearly established 
that it was unlawful. And so the officer gets immunity from civil suit.
Sean: Thanks for clarifying that. And look, I don't know if there's any training that can 
prevent someone from panicking when that fight or flight instinct kicks in, I mean that that's 
deep down in our wiring, but it's still shocking when you start looking at this how 
undertrained American police are. 
Rosa: Yes. 
Sean: It is incredible how little training these people have, and I suspect a lot of police 
interactions that go wrong are not the result of bad people out to do bad things. It's the 
result of poorly trained human beings responding.
Rosa: Poorly trained, scared people.
Sean: Yeah, responding badly under duress in situations for which they're totally 
unprepared, and that seems like a training slash screening problem.
Rosa: It is to some extent at least, yes. The length of police training in many European 
countries is three years. It's treated like a university degree before you're out there on the 
streets. Um, in the US, most departments DC it's six months of training. In New York, it's 
roughly the same, but there are jurisdictions in the US where it is six weeks, not six months. 
Six weeks, and you're out there with your gun and your badge and your arrest powers.
And even in places where it's six months, like DC. I was actually talking to a, a DC police 
officer this morning who was lamenting exactly this. He said, it's like a joke. You know, you 
never get refreshers. The, the mandatory refresher training is brief. It's usually a bunch of 
PowerPoints. You re-qualify on your gun at the shooting rage, and you're good to go again.
And it's not. The military has an adage, you fight how you train, meaning that if you haven't 
trained over and over and over for scenarios, you're not gonna be prepared. And I think the 
same is true for policing. The trouble is it's really expensive and hard to train people really 
well, right? It would take several years.
You have to do lots and lots of role play and scenario based training. You want people to 
really internalize better responses to things, and it's not something. That Americans tend to 
wanna spend money on, especially right now, you know that there's a lot of cynicism, Oh, 
training that's not gonna do any good.
So then it becomes kind of a, a vicious circle. 
The recruiting piece is also a vicious circle. If you go on YouTube and you Google police 
recruiting videos, The majority of what you're gonna find out there is gonna be police 
departments that recruit with videos that involve people jumping out of helicopters and 
smashing doors down and tackling fleeing suspects.
Well, if that's your message to the world, you're gonna recruit people who wanna go tackle 
fleeing suspects and smash doors in, and that becomes kind of self-fulfilling if you're 
recruiting and saying, this is what being a police officer involves. Involves a lot of force, it 
involves a lot of physical activity, military vision of policing.
The people who are attracted to that probably are exactly the wrong people for policing. 
Whereas if you present policing as a, as a service profession, you know, as a a helping 
profession, you attract a different kind of people. But right now we're at a moment when 
police departments all over the country are having a terribly difficult time recruiting anybody. 
Just keeping their numbers up. Just replacing people who leave and retire, because right 
now people think, oh boy, who would wanna be a police officer? Either you don't wanna do 
it because you think, why would I wanna join this violent, militaristic organization that hurts 
people?
Or you think, well, I think I could be a good police officer, but everybody hates police 
officers. Why would I want to go do something where everybody's gonna hate me?
Sean: I live near New Orleans and I've been there quite a bit recently and it's, I don't know 
how indicative this is of other cities around the country, but they've got a massive problem 
of simply not having enough cops. People are calling 911 and they're saying, sorry, nobody 
can respond. I mean, it's, it's a pretty dire situation.
Rosa: Yeah, although the one thing I would challenge there, going back to what I said 
about 75 or 80% of what police officers do has nothing to do with crime. Most 911 calls do 
not require an armed, uniformed agent of the state to show up at the door and very often we 
get into these conversations, oh, crime is up we need more police officers, or too many 911 
calls are coming. We need more police officers. It's not actually particularly clear to me that 
we need more police officers. Maybe we need fewer police officers trained differently, doing 
different things and more people who are not armed police officers, who are trained 
differently, who can respond to many, not all, but to many of the kinds of calls that come in.
Sean: We've just witnessed the killing of Tyre Nichols down in Memphis. 
Rosa: Yeah.
Sean: I'm not even sure where to start, to be honest. So I guess I'll ask… how you 
processed what happened there.
Rosa: Yeah. Honestly, I didn't watch those videos. It just felt so voyeuristic to watch the 
videos, uh, like, it's like a snuff film. And I do think that's become a little bit of an issue in this 
country, that there's a sort of ritualistic watching of these videos. And it's very difficult 
because on the one hand, you can't turn away from these things because we wanna 
change them.
But on the other hand, if we sort of start, you know, kind of wallowing in these depictions of 
pain, particularly black pain. You know, I think that that has some problems too, right? It's 
really hard. It feels sort of morally wrong both ways, right? It feels morally wrong not to 
watch it. It also feels morally wrong to watch it.
The Tyre Nichols killing. Um, I think there's another piece of this, well, two other pieces of 
this that I would pull out. One is that people have lots of like, well, how you know these were 
black officers, why would they do this thing? You know, police culture's very powerful. And 
police of whatever, race, gender, et cetera, very often their identities, police can start feeling 
more powerful to them than their identity, whether it's racial or ethnic or religious, or gender, 
whatever it might be.
And the studies on diversification of police departments, they do suggest that police 
departments that mirror the populations more racially, et cetera, have higher degrees of 
public satisfaction, but they do not suggest that they have lower levels of lethal force 
necessarily. And I think part of the reason for that is that people forget that it's not just about 
racism.
There's also a pretty heavy dollop of classism in there of, hey, we middle class people, 
regardless of race, here are these people who we've discounted as people. They're they're 
poor, they're quote unquote trash. And that dynamic is powerful in many police departments 
is one piece of it. The other piece though, which has nothing to do with race as such, goes 
back to what I said earlier about police getting cynical and they spend all day, every day 
seeing the worst of people. They much like many in the communities in which they operate, 
they're often severely traumatized. The rates of PTSD usually undiagnosed among cops, 
are extraordinarily high. More cops die by suicide every year than of every other cause 
combined. And the research is crystal clear, not just for police, but across every occupation. 
Traumatized people often lash out in really terrible ways. You know, they, they beat up their 
wife or their kid, they drive too fast.
They pick fights at bars. And I think that that's a piece of this too. I mean, I don't know 
enough about these particular officers, but I do think that unacknowledged trauma can 
make people cruel. It can make people lash out. 
Sean: You know, a lot of people are learning about this elite unit, whatever the hell that 
means. In the Memphis pd, they called it the Scorpion unit. This is the unit that was involved 
in the Nichols killing, and there are lots of comparable units like this across the country. You 
know, plain closed cops and unmarked cars using very aggressive tactics.
What do you make of these types of units? Are they, are they dangerous by design? Is 
there any evidence that they work? Even if the tactics are a little dicey,
Rosa: Uh, you know, depends what you mean by work, right.
Sean: reduce crime.
Rosa: I mean, in a very temporary way, yes, they can. If by work we mean, have you 
arrested a lot of people and temporarily reduced like gun? Usually they're targeting things 
like gun crime, but in a sort of longer term way. Usually what tends to happen is that the 
people who are participating in gun crimes just move to a different neighborhood, you know, 
and they.
You've got these units kind of chasing people around the city, but also in the longer term, I 
think they, you know, again, not always, and I, I, I think different police departments 
structure units like this different ways from one another, but what they can end up doing 
when they go bad is they actually engender so much community hostility because for every 
guy who they stop and frisk, who's got illegal weapons, who they arrest, they're stopping a 
hundred people who are just going about their business and, okay, good news, you got one 
possibly dangerous guy off the street and you've got a hundred people who don't trust you 
anymore and who dislike you and who are now less likely to tell you anything and less likely 
to help you solve any crimes or prevent any crimes.
And you know, one of the many of dirty little secrets of policing is that police aren't very 
good at preventing or solving most crimes. The homicide clearance rates in many cities 
hover somewhere between 75% and 25% depending on the place. Lots and lots of 
homicides go unsolved. Burglaries Carjackings even more likely to go unsolved unless the 
perpetrator is sort of running away as the police get on the scene or as someone known to 
the victim.
It's can be extraordinarily hard for police to do anything, and preventing crime has also just 
been tremendously difficult, and made more so by community mistrust. If community 
members are scared of you and don't like you, they're not gonna go to you and say, Hey, 
I'm really worried about the kid downstairs.
I saw him boasting to his friends about how many guns and carjackings they, you know, 
you're not gonna say that to somebody who you don't trust. And needless to say, even if 
you trust the police, if you think that the American penal system and criminal justice system 
writ large is going to mishandle things and it will.
Our criminal justice system actually makes the people who have contact with it more likely 
to commit new crimes rather than less likely. Even if you like the police, you may be very 
wary of turning somebody over to that system, which may make things worse.
music 

After one last short break, I’ll ask Rosa what she thinks about the 
movement to defund or even abolish the police.

 

MIDROLL 2

Music

Sean: We've been sort of circling around some of the arguments about. Abolishing or, or 
defunding the police. There are caricatured versions of these arguments and there are more 
nuanced versions of them, and I, I want to try to engage with the more nuanced versions of 
them. You know, and I'm not sure where you stand on any of this, but I'll, I'll start by just 
kind of laying my cards on the table.
I mean, my main objection to a lot of these sorts of arguments is that I really do think we 
need to professionalize the police. 
Rosa: Yeah.
Sean: That is a phrase coined by others, not me.
Rosa: Different police. Not necessarily no police.
Sean: Yeah, right, because if nothing else seemed like the right direction to go. But again, 
very importantly, that would require more, not less funding.
And for lots of reasons, people aren't really pumped about giving more money to cops who 
they continue to see on their screens brutalizing people.
Rosa: Yeah. I think to me the issue comes down to the sort of defund. I'm not an 
abolitionist. I think we're always going to need some people who can use coercion on behalf 
of the state, but I'm sympathetic to the underlying logic of the defund movement, but I think 
there's sort of a short term and there's a long term. Long term when you think about, well, 
what, what would we like community safety to look like in 50 years say?
I would like there to be fewer police, doing fewer things. I would like us to have fewer police 
who are reserved for the really serious violent situations where nothing else is gonna work, 
and I would like us to have cadres of wonderful social workers, and teachers, and doctors, 
and you name it, who really are flooding neighborhoods where there's a lot of need and who 
are responding to that stuff that right now comes to cops that doesn't involve crimes.
You know, I'd like to see that, but we don't have that right now, and we're not gonna get to it 
next year or in two years or in three years. Maybe we could start getting close to it in a 
decade. Probably not for a generation, because if we want those wonderful social workers 
to go, well, we're gonna have to train people, we're gonna have to recruit people, we're 
gonna have to pay people.
It's gonna be a hard job. They're gonna need a lot of training. They don't exist right now by 
and large people sort of blithely talk about, well, couldn't we send a social worker, you 
know, your average social worker is doing therapy or they're a school counselor, they're not 
prepared to go into a high crime neighborhood at two in the morning where drunk people 
are fighting with each other. We just don't have them right now. And we need to be thinking 
now in every city in the country well, if here's where we wanna be in, in 50 years, if we want 
to have a really different allocation of public funds and et cetera, et cetera, like what do we 
do today to make it more likely we're there in 50 years, and then what do we do next year 
and the year after that?
And it's gonna be, even if the political will exists to do it, it's gonna be a long, long process. 
And there are gonna be mistakes and one of those social workers is gonna get killed, and 
everybody's gonna start saying, oh, see what a terrible mistake you made.
Sean: Yeah.
Rosa: You know, and I would be saying, terrible things do happen. That doesn't mean the 
whole idea's a bad idea. And we, we do this all the time. We let the one bad thing sour us 
on something. I mean, that's exactly what police do, right? They say, well, this happened in 
this one instance. It must happen all the time, even when it doesn't. 
Sean: Right.
Rosa: So that's kind of where I come down.
Sean: And this is the thing I would say in defense. I mean, the fact that cops spend so 
much of their time on non-violent crimes and minor drug offenses and these sorts of things 
is such a problem. They should spend much more time screening, much more time doing 
training on de escalation and how to communicate more effectively.
That's part of the professionalization I'm talking about. But also, they should be focused 
more on actual violent crimes because so much of the other stuff amounts to harassment 
and extortion and a waste of time and resources and I, I don't have any idea how many 
violent police interactions involve people with disabilities or mental health issues that never 
would've happened if those people had gotten the help they needed, which is why the call 
for better social services and more funding for social services are absolutely necessary.
Rosa: I mean, we Americans are short-term thinkers. We don't have a lot of patience and 
that's, I think, one of our national characteristics that's always tripping us up. This is not 
gonna get better in a couple years, you know, much less a couple months as some cities 
kind of go, oh, we tried that onto something else. This is gonna take a really long time and 
we're gonna have to be willing to experiment. We're gonna have to be willing to have 
failures and learn from them. And I don't know that the American public, much less the 
people who elect to represent us at various levels have the stomach for that kind of longer 
term thinking. But it is absolutely the only thing that's gonna get us out of this situation that 
we're in right now.
Sean: We ran an old Vox Conversations episode earlier this week with my terrific colleague, 
Fabiola Cineas, and she was in dialogue with the police abolitionist whose name was 
Derecka Purnell. who made a lot of genuinely interesting points. But she also said 
something that crystallized a kind of first principle objection for me, and I'm curious what 
you think you know, she'd said that the goal was ultimately to eradicate violence from 
society.
And for me, there will always be violence in society and we will need police to deal with it. 
And while I appreciate the call to imagine a different world and to reexamine our deepest 
assumptions about our current one. I am pretty firm on this point, as firm as I can be. And 
yet at the same time, I'm also a white guy who has never felt threatened by the police and I 
don't know what that's like.
And I do think there's a moral obligation to take that seriously.
Rosa: Yeah. Okay. But I guess I have two reactions, one of which is more agreement with 
her, and the other of which is more disagreement. The more disagreement piece is that 
people are always saying, well, we should listen to people in the affected communities, 
meaning people of color in particular, but they're not homogeneous either.
You know? And in fact, a majority of black Americans, and in particular, a majority of black 
Americans who live in high crime neighborhoods, they do not want fewer police officers . 
They want different, better policing, but they don't want fewer. But as I said, there's short 
term and there's long term, and wouldn't it be nice to get to. No violence, but there's a pretty 
long in the meantime, if we ever get there, you know, maybe we can kind of get ever closer. 
But I agree with you. I don't think we're ever gonna get there. I agree with her that I don't 
think that means we shouldn't try.
You know, of course we should be trying. We should be trying to eradicate violence with 
recognition, the awareness all the time. We probably won't succeed, but that maybe we can 
reduce it and reduce it and reduce it and reduce it to a level that is less crippling societally. 
But I think that as long as there is violence, we can't also ignore the fact that it is poor 
people of color who are also the victims of the vast majority of violent crimes in this country. 
And it's not good enough to sort of say to them, good news, everybody. We've decided that 
the real problem is police, so we're not gonna have any police anymore. Well, believing that 
structural racism exists, you can believe that and still believe that there are people right this 
minute who, if there are no police, will commit more crimes and will hurt more people.
And that doesn't mean were there no structural inequalities, et cetera. Would they have 
turned out that way? Maybe not. You know, but we're where we are right now, and we can't 
just wish it away. 
I do think that the abolitionist terminology and the defund terminology have not done any 
favors for those movements because I, I think that when you frame it differently, when you 
frame it as one that is more inclusive to invite police officers to actually be part of the 
conversation. You end up with a much better, more constructive conversation when you 
frame it as, Hey, we all share a goal of making the society less violent and less racist, et 
cetera. That's our goal. We all share that goal. We all think that it doesn't really make sense 
for police to be mediating arguments between a teenage kid and their parent.
Somebody with a gun there may make things worse rather than better. We all can agree on 
that. And now let's talk nitty gritty. Let's talk. How do we move forward in a way that relieves 
police officers of tasks that they generally do not wanna be doing? Don't feel well-equipped 
for, desperately want some other city agency to step in and do instead of them. They're 
actually gonna be, in many cases, allies. 
We run a program here at Georgetown. It's a fellowship program with young DC police 
officers, and we had a session last week. We had a workshop where this was exactly the 
issue, and the officers were expressing incredible frustration about the fact that they 
encounter over and over and over again situations where they want to refer people to social 
services, you know, to counseling, to safe places if they're victims of domestic violence, 
whatever it may be. And they're like, we call the Department of Behavioral Health and 
nobody answers the phone ever. So I actually think that you start asking police to be part of 
that conversation. They become some of the biggest advocates for funding all those other 
things.
Sean: Earlier you talked about some of the research on police training, and you talked 
about the importance of instilling cops with a sense of self-confidence, so they aren’t acting 
out of fear. And I think we can say that, if that’s a goal of police training — and it seems a 
worthy goal… that it’s not working right now. Many cops report that they are afraid of getting 
into violent interactions, or about whether or not a suspect is armed. Especially in these 
high-profile instances of police violence, we hear that officers are afraid. So is there 
something that we can do in training to make cops less afraid? To instill them with more 
confidence, so that they aren’t primarily acting out of fear?
Rosa: Yeah. I mean, I think in an ideal world we would have older cops for one thing. Right 
now there's this recruiting crisis. Police departments can't be very picky. But you know, the 
United Nations, this is decade or more ago, raised the minimum age for UN peacekeeping 
soldiers to 25, and that's because they found that the vast majority of situations that 
involved abusive behavior by soldiers involve very young soldiers.
And that you raise the age of 25 people start aging out of being jerks. You know, they really. 
And that if you can restrict it to somewhat older soldiers, that you're gonna have far fewer 
problems. Not none, but fewer. You know, in an ideal world, I think we would see being a 
police officer, something that is not your first job out of high school.
You know, something that you have to get to after lived experience, and lots and lots of 
training, recruiting people for their problem solving skills, for their critical thinking, for their 
communication skills, and every police chief in the country will tell you that that's what they 
want. We'll say, this is what we need.
This is actually not like the military where you're gonna be out there with 50 other people 
and a command structure and somebody can tell you what to do. Our police officers are out 
there all by themselves, and yes, they can call their sergeant or they can call for backup. 
But there's probably gonna be a significant period of time in any situation where it's gonna 
be one or two officers alone having to decide how to handle a situation.
And that really means that you want people who have really good judgment or really good 
communicators, et cetera, because they're gonna have to make decisions for themselves, 
which in turn of course, means that you need not only to recruit people with those skills and 
characteristics in mind, but have training that really reinforces those.
I mean, I had a conversation with, uh, a senior official in the DC police department who was 
saying that he felt like one of the things a lot of the new recruits at the police Academy 
lacked, it wasn't just, they didn't have deescalation skills, they just did know how to talk to 
people. And he attributed a little bit to generational stuff of people who have got their heads 
in their phones.
They don't have the face-to-face interactions. And he was saying, They're really trying to 
think of ways to literally force those recruits to go talk to people. Like your assignment for 
the next two hours is to have conversations with 10 people to walk around the street, you 
know, have conversations with people, just say hi and to just practice that.
And it sounds so dumb, right? It sounds like, well, everybody knows how to talk, right? And 
that's sort of an undervalued skill, but a tremendous amount of policing is learning how to 
say, okay. Wow. Boy, you know, I can see you're pretty upset. I'd be upset too. Well, okay. 
Well this, you know what's going on here? Huh?
Okay. Well maybe we can solve this problem.
Sean: We're dealing with an impossibly complicated dynamic and lots of people are justified 
in their anger and there just isn't a way out of this. And it's partly because there is lots of 
anger to go around, justifiable anger to go around that we can't move forward. It's just, it's 
kind of dispiriting.
Rosa: You know, one of the things I also hear a lot of my friends who are still police officers 
saying is this frustration. police departments like everybody else in the universe, they value 
what they can measure. And you can measure things like arrests. It's very hard to measure 
situations that were diffused that could have gone wrong.
You know, it's the dog that doesn't bark in the night, right? And so they say, You go on 
YouTube and it's nothing but these terrible videos of police doing awful things. And you 
know, they, they've sort of naive. They're often sort of like, why aren't there videos of police 
doing good things ? Because we do good things all the time and they're not wrong, but.
Nobody bothers to put on YouTube or is even recording in the first place. You know the 
interaction that goes really well, the interaction that's pleasant or the interaction where the 
police officer successfully diffuses a really tense situation and everybody goes away and it's 
resolved and it's not even forget the general public seeing those videos, right?
Police express frustration that their sergeants don't see it either, and nobody. Is tracking or 
knows how to track who deescalated the most situations. And it's not that the cops don't 
know, right? They absolutely know. Institutionally it's not rewarded in part because it's hard 
to quantify, and that's part of the dilemma.
Sean: Well, in the interest of ending this on a more constructive, optimistic note. You 
mentioned the program that you, you help run at Georgetown for young cops in DC. This is 
a program where you talk about race and violence and the role of policing and all that stuff. 
Do you feel that work there is actually making a difference and giving you more hope?
Rosa: I do. I really do. And yeah, that's the thing that really gives me hope. We're now in 
our fourth cohort of fellows. So all told, I think we've, maybe… we've had about 70 officers 
go through this and they're great. And they're super thoughtful. You know, they're super 
self-aware. They really want to grapple with all of these issues.
And I feel like that's part of what we hope will be a generational change in policing, at least 
in this city, that those young officers will rise in the ranks, and they will, we hope, you know, 
seed new ideas throughout the department and we really emphasize a big part of the 
program is talking to them about, what does it mean to be a change agent within an 
organization? You know, how do you do that when you're in a rigid, hierarchical 
organization? And I can think of multiple examples of things that have come out of the 
discussions we've had in those workshops or things that have been part of projects that our 
fellows have done that have turned into policy for the department.
Whether it's new policies for police interactions with adolescents, or whether it's better 
training on officer wellness, or whether it’s some changes to police academy curriculum. 
You know, no single one of them is remotely transformative. But going back to the kind of 
harm reduction concept, no question in my mind: these young officers who've gone through 
this program have done really concrete things that have made the department a little bit 
better.
And it doesn't solve racism. It doesn't solve poverty. It doesn't solve violence and crime, but 
it makes life a little better for some, you know, for at least a few people, and it probably 
saves a few lives and, and that's not chopped liver.
Sean: Well, I think it's such great work and I commend you for doing it and for having a, a 
few skins in the game and kind of getting your hands a little dirty as it were. So, Rosa 
Brooks, you are always a source of wisdom and insight. Thank you so much for being here.
Rosa: My pleasure, Sean. Thank you so much for having me.

This really is a tough one. This is a very fraught issue for lots of understandable 
reasons. I really appreciate the fact not just that Rosa has a unique perspective being a 
law professor and having worked on the streets as a cop, she also really is trying to be 
constructive here. She runs a program down at Georgetown that brings in young cops 
and helps them think through these issues and imagine doing policing differently, and 
better, and I commend her for that.
