COLD INTRO:
If I told you that the way you grew up — your family situation, your environment, all of it – had 
an enormous impact on who you are today, you’d probably say … “Well, yeah, obviously…”

You don’t need a psychology degree to connect those dots…

But what if I told you that the way you grew up might be the most significant influence on your 
romantic relationships as an adult?

On some level, this may not be all that surprising either, since who we are as individuals 
determines who we are as partners or spouses… How could it not?

Still, even if the basic idea here is clear enough, I’m not sure most of us appreciate just how 
much the past influences our present…

The reality is that so much of our personality – how we think, what we expect from other people, 
what we expect from ourselves – is shaped very early by the people we love and rely on the 
most…  

So if you want to understand why you do what you do … Or why you often don’t do what you 
wish you did … It helps to look back at your life and find the roots of these patterns…

ID: I’m Sean Illing, and this… is the Gray Area.

My guest today is Vienna Pharaon … She’s a couples therapist who’s developed a pretty large 
following on social media. And she’s just published her first book called The Origins of You: 
How Breaking Family Patterns Can Liberate the Way We Live and Love…

This book is an attempt to force us to look closely at our own origin story … To reflect on where 
we came from and how those experiences color who we are in our relationships today … And 
she identifies several different kinds of what she calls “origin wounds” that shape our patterns of 
behavior later in life…

Pharaon’s book landed on my desk at an interesting moment for me … I’m married and have a 
very young son and, like everyone else, I’m navigating all the challenges that this entails …

So this conversation was an opportunity to explore themes that are both personal and universal 
… We’re all trying to be better partners, we’re all trying to understand ourselves, and hopefully 
we’re all just trying to do life better… whatever that means.

But I started by asking Vienna to lay out her approach to therapy.
music 

Vienna: So my title is Marriage and Family Therapist. I work with individuals, couples, and 
families, all within the context of relationships and really understanding the origin, pain and 
wounds that we accrue in our childhoods. So the lens through which I see people and 
relationships is through their family of origin, the family system or systems in which they grew.
To see that there is a larger system at play in every moment, right? When we have unwanted 
patterns in our adult lives, we keep getting into the same conflict with a partner or a parent. We 
keep choosing emotionally unavailable people to date. We're chronically unhappy at every job 
that we hold. For me, if we can't create a quick change, right, if there's resistance there, if 
there's friction there, then that's a pretty good indicator that there's something unresolved from 
our past.
And the place that I like to go is our family. I like to understand the template, right? That's our 
first education on just about everything. You know, we obviously get other people in there at 
different points, teachers, coaches, religion, et cetera, right? Like all of these influences that 
start to shape our belief systems.
But our family system is the first system where that education is, is handed over to us. A lot of 
times when people come in for individual therapy, it's really easy to just stay focused on that 
one person's experience, you know, the story that they're sharing. And I try to always keep other 
people in the room even when they're not there physically.
We all know that we have complex histories. We have a story that is rich, and when we can 
keep that in mind when we're thinking about relational patterns that are breaking down, that's so 
helpful to remember that our partner, or our parent, or our sibling has a lot of context that's 
worth understanding.
Sean: Yeah. You know, I'm glad you said that because I don't think anyone will be surprised to 
hear that our childhoods, our family dynamics growing up influences how we behave as adults. 
But why do you think it's worth really emphasizing, not just how that impacts us as individuals, 
but how it impacts our relationships?
Because maybe it's the relationships part that is perhaps less understood than the individual 
part.
Vienna: Yeah. Right, and I think you're right that a lot of people can say like, sure, I can connect 
some of these dots and that makes a lot of rational sense. But I am a big believer that the 
unresolved pain from our past comes along with us. Our pain is not out to destroy our lives. Our 
pain is not out to ruin us, right?
Our wounds are tugging at us because they want attention and they find these really clever 
ways, right? Like our internal system is brilliant and super fascinating, the ways in which it will 
bring us back into contact with pain that is unresolved. And what we know to be true is that 
relationships are the greatest way for that pain to play itself out over and over and over again.
So, whether it's a romantic partnership, whether, you know, the listeners who have children, 
who know our children are such great mirrors for us, and they bring us into contact with a lot of 
that stuff, right? It's like relationships are where so much of that plays out. You know, you have 
so many people who are like, okay, I'm here to understand it.
But understanding only takes us so far. There's only so much that we can do as individuals 
thinking about, and yeah, maybe processing on our own as well, but I find that if it's 
relationships that contributed to our pain, then it's relationships that need to contribute to our 
healing as well. And so, yeah.
Why we really need to explore this through the context of relationships.
Sean: I'm curious, what is the first thing, if there is a first thing, you want to know about 
someone's family history when they come to you with relationship problems?
Vienna: There are many things I want to know about. Probably one of the first questions is, 
what did you want as a child and not get? That'll bring us right to it, you know, even noticing like, 
oof. Yeah. Is there like a little bit of feeling sensation just hearing that question right now. You 
know, my parents, part of what got me into this work, of course, is my own personal story, 
unsurprisingly, for all therapists.
When people are like, how did therapists get into this work? It's like, yeah, we're figuring out 
how to resolve our unresolved pain, right? My parents, they went through a nine-year divorce 
process. It was the longest divorce at the time for New Jersey. It was intense and there was just 
a lot of high conflict.
There was a lot of psychological abuse, manipulation, gaslighting, paranoia, emotional flooding, 
like it was not an easy system to grow up in. And I'm an only child, so as a tiny little human, I 
was really there on my own. And I think my parents obviously did what they could, and all of my 
main needs were taken care of.
But, I took on this role of seeing the adults in my life crashing and burning around me. I believed 
that there wasn't room for me to not be okay, because my perception of them was that they 
were not okay. That not only were they not okay, they were drowning. And so I started to fly 
under the radar. I started to pretend like I was fine.
I was unaffected by things. I didn't wanna add any type of stress or burden to their already full 
plates. And, that role, you know, I took on and I kept it for decades, you know, it wasn't until late 
in my twenties and it clicked in at one moment in a conversation with a friend. It's like, ah, this 
needless little girl who pretended like she was unaffected by all of the things that were going on 
in her life and in her family became a needless woman who was presenting as the quote 
unquote “cool girl,” right?
This woman who, yeah, do whatever you want. I'm totally fine. I'm totally unaffected. No worries. 
I was fully boundaryless, and that role had come along with me, and I was maintaining this 
position in my relationships. You know, I couldn't speak up in romantic partnerships. I couldn't 
speak up in friendships.
I just was pretending that I was so unbothered and unaffected by things. And it wasn't until that 
moment where I could make a pivot and actually for the first time say, ‘I'm not okay. I am 
affected by this.’ That might sound so simple, but that was a life-changing moment for me to let 
those words actually come out.
And I share that story because we can sometimes see so clearly how our past comes with us, 
but other times it comes in such subtle ways, right? Whether we're recreating and repeating 
certain patterns, or whether we're taking a path of opposition where we don't even see what's 
going on. And you know, for me it is so important to not just understand, but to do the 
processing work in order to shift that and find a new path forward.
Sean: Well, let me just first express some solidarity with you as a fellow only child, also from a 
broken home. So, I can, I can relate in some ways to that. I encountered that question in your 
book, you know, what did you most need as a kid and not get, and boy, that was a big one. I 
thought about the answer to this. Um, and, it's huge.
Vienna: Yeah. It points us though, to, you know, in the book I talk about five origin wounds and 
you know, my answer to that question led me to an origin wound that really needed my 
attention. I wanted to know that it was okay for me to not be okay.
Sean: And that origin wound for you? That's the divorce?
Vienna: Yeah. So in the beginning of the book, I share a story. I was in first grade and that 
particular weekend was supposed to be the three of us. And you know, my dad was watching a 
Yankees game. My mom wanted to go to the beach, he didn't wanna go. And she invited my 
grandmother to come along with us. And you know, I'm this little girl behind a closed door in her 
bedroom and I hear, if you leave, don't come back.
And, you know, the next thing I know is that my mom's barreling upstairs, having me pack a bag 
and we're leaving. And there's a lot that happens after that. You know, we don't go home. We 
go to my grandmother's home, police are involved. I'm hiding in a closet, you know, instructed to 
not make a sound.
Yeah. There's this rupture that makes me have to split my loyalty, like, how do I take care of 
mom and dad? How do they both know that I love them? And all of a sudden I'm in this position 
where I'm having to choose one over the other. And so, you know, that was the, that was the 
catalyst, right?
That was the, the rupture that then led into the nine year divorce process. And, you know, all of 
that contributes to the lack of emotional safety, psychological safety as well.
Sean: So what… what drew me to your book is this focus on patterns. Patterns of thought and 
patterns of behavior. Obviously, those things are related, and how we get stuck in them, and 
one of the greatest frustrations in my life at the moment is this feeling of being almost hostage to 
extremely dumb impulses. Like, I can often see myself doing or saying something in real time, 
often with my wife.
I know it's stupid. I know it's counterproductive. I know it can only escalate a situation, and yet I 
plow ahead anyway. And there is this maddening feeling of knowing what I should do and not 
doing it. Maybe you'd call that self-sabotage, maybe you'd call it being a dumbass. I, I don't 
know. Like, those obviously aren't mutually exclusive.
What do you tell people when they experience some version of this? Like, when they just can't 
quite overcome what they know are terrible impulses?
Vienna: Yeah, so self-sabotage: I'd reframe it as something that is self-protective. What does it 
serve to do the thing that you do, even though you know you ought not do it? Like I said before, 
our systems are brilliant, and so we're constantly working in a way to protect ourselves from 
something. 
Now, unfortunately, a lot of times that's an old operating system, right? It's protecting us from 
something that's unresolved, unhealed, right? As opposed to protecting us in the sense that it's 
supporting and working us towards our goals and our healing and connection. 
I wonder if you and I have some similarities. It sounds like maybe. You didn't get too specific 
with that, but it makes me think about a story.
When I was first dating my now husband, we were in a conflict, no idea what the conflict was 
about, but I remember acutely that I could not stop proving my point, and I just kept going. I 
doubled down, I tripled down, and I was having this out of body experience where I was like, 
Vienna, shut up. You know, just like, stop.
Can you take it back? You know, there was a lot of shame and embarrassment there. I was like, 
I could see this part of me that just like needed to be right, needed to prove my point, and yet I 
couldn't stop myself from it. And I realized like, okay, what does point-proving serve? Right? 
What does the need to be right protect me from? 
And I grew up with a father who was really manipulative. He gaslit my mom and he was really 
quick with his words, you know, he was really, really good at it. And as a tiny human, I watched 
this and I saw the impact that it had on my mother. It was, it was quite literally crazy-making. 
And so I started to understand that my need to be right was my way of protecting myself. That 
being wrong was quite dangerous for me, right? That's what I had learned, right? That being 
wrong meant that I would be manipulated, that I would be taken advantage of, right? And so 
being right was safety for me. Proving my point was the way in which I safeguarded myself from 
the things from the past.
That was such an important revelation for me because I needed to understand that, okay, yes, 
as a little girl, that made a lot of sense. But if I kept at this, right, if I didn't start to pay attention to 
that unresolved pain of what I saw growing up, then I would continue to loop into that, and I 
needed to find a way to process and witness that and grieve the pain from the past so that I 
could make a new choice in this current relationship, right?
Because I did not have a partner who was manipulative. I have a very honest, kind, loving, open 
partner, and if I did not change that, you run the risk of having relationships end. Right? Like 
that's, that's the consequence to all of this.
Sean: Yeah. Well, you know, I don't know where it comes from with me, maybe this will, maybe 
this will come out in the context of this conversation. For me, it, it really does feel like this 
impulse to behave in ways I know are unhealthy, is so strong that it, it can feel like almost a 
nervous system sort of thing.
And I don't wanna accept that because I don't wanna rob myself of agency to do otherwise. But 
it really does feel like that sometimes. And I don't know if part of it is me almost thriving on 
conflict, right? Where like I'm choosing, I'm choosing conflict because that almost feels more 
familiar and safe than actually just choosing to interpret a situation differently that would push in 
the opposite direction.
Vienna: Absolutely. Right. I mean, I think we go in the direction of familiarity, but I wa, like, 
where does it lead you? You know, when you engage in whatever the destructive behavior is, 
where do you get to?
Sean: With acting that way?
Vienna: Mm-hmm.
Sean: Escalation.
Vienna: Mm-hmm. Conflict. And then how do you feel when you're in that escalation and 
conflict?
Sean: Um, in an almost perverse way, I feel almost more comfortable because I'm very much at 
ease when my guard is up, like I'm very comfortable fighting. I'm very comfortable arguing. I'm 
very comfortable attacking and deflecting. It's almost a safer space than being vulnerable, right? 
And so I just naturally retreat to that.
Vienna: Yeah. Right. So, okay. One, where did you learn that from? Two, what does that 
protect you from? Three. What story does that wind up ultimately supporting for you?
Sean: You know what… the story it ultimately ends up supporting is that everything is fucked. 
And what I mean by that, right? Look, if, if I was on your therapist's couch and I kind of am right 
now, and you asked me what's the one habit or the one part of my personality that I most want 
to change, what I would tell you is that I'm a catastrophizer very often, and this is something that 
I, how should I put this?
It's not great for me or my relationships. Right? And for anyone unfamiliar with that term, like 
what I mean is there is this instinct to almost pre-prepare for disaster by not just imagining all 
the ways something could go wrong. But actually, like, conjuring reasons to blow it up before it 
goes wrong.
And so anytime I sniff conflict, I just, my mind will immediately go to, oh yeah, of course, right? 
Because things are messed up and we're broken, and of course this is just validation of all of 
that. And it, it, it becomes self-fulfilling and it's totally delusional, often.
Vienna: Well, but you're describing a hypervigilance right? 
Sean: Hmm. What does that mean? That sounds right, but.
Vienna: Like the part of you that's constantly scanning and pre-preparing for something to go 
wrong, and the inquiry would be, what's familiar about that? When did you have to prepare? 
Right? Why did you need to look out for things going wrong? Why did you need to look out for 
things going south?
It's not to put you on the spot, but I imagine that there is some history in your life where you 
learned that there's a need for hypervigilance.
Sean: You know, I think fear probably has a lot to do with it. Fear of what exactly I, I can't say, I 
mean, maybe you would call it a safety wound that stems from my being an only child from a 
broken home with very young parents who were trying to figure out how to be parents before 
they were probably ready to be parents. And so part of it feels very much like a defense 
mechanism.
Vienna: Certainly. To have young parents who are figuring it out often creates an environment 
where a child has to do some figuring out themselves. I don't know if that resonates for you, but 
they don't necessarily know what to be thinking of next, or, because there's an immaturity that 
might have been there, then you have to become the observer, the hyper-vigilant one, or just 
vigilant one to say, well, hey, my needs over here. Hey, we've gotta look out for this. Or, Hey, 
what about that? If they're not as attuned or aware, which can happen when we have adults 
stepping into a role that maybe is slightly premature for them.
It reminds me of this one story that I share in the book about Natasha, and she's coming into 
therapy and she's trying to figure out whether or not she should stay in the relationship with 
Clyde, who is this wonderful man, but she keeps thinking that the other shoe is going to drop 
and she doesn't know why, and at first she doesn't wanna talk about her family, past at all.
She's like, no, like I'm here to figure out if I should stay with him or not. We're about to get 
engaged and I need this answer. And a little bit into our therapy. I learned that when she was a 
teenager, she stumbled upon an email that was open on her father's computer, and it was 
between her father and a woman who wasn't her mother.
He walks in on her, he sees her crying. He says, please don't tell your mother or sister. I 
promise I'll cut it off. And she holds that secret for him, forever. It was the first time that she had 
spoken that out loud to anyone, right was to me in that session decades later. She had 
absorbed it in such a way and then had to go on pretending like nothing had ever happened, 
which makes sense as to why she said, you know, I have a great family and great, great 
childhood, that it didn't strike her, that the other shoe dropping came from this origin story.
And she was going through life in her romantic relationships, waiting for the other shoe to drop, 
exiting those relationships early for really no reason, but just, because of the anticipation of 
something could go wrong, you cannot trust people even if they present like they are 
phenomenal humans. Right? And that was such an opener for us because it brought us to the 
part of her that needed to process the origin pain, that needed to witness this teenager who was 
asked to hold a secret, who did, and what that did to her.
And then to grieve the emotions that were there so that she could then choose to be committed 
and move forward with a partner who was actually a great fit and really aligned for her. And so 
you can see how sometimes when we don't have that awareness, the past unresolved or 
untouched pain can create and maintain these behaviors and these patterns.
And so for you, or for anybody who's listening who resonates with this, right? Like, that's the 
inquiry.
Sean: Well, I'm glad you brought up that story. It's about trust, you know, a lack of trust and, 
and that's a very common problem in relationships, and it's easy to understand in certain 
situations like infidelity or something, that's an obvious breach of trust that's very hard to get 
back. But I think a lack of trust often shows up in much quieter, deeper ways for a lot of us, and 
that is harder to diagnose.
But every bit as consequential. Like for example, like, like maybe, you know, we don't open 
ourselves up to someone because we're worried about being judged or even more insidious: 
We assume the worst intentions from our partner for perhaps lots of reasons that have nothing 
to do with them, that predate them.
But seeing someone through that filter of suspicion is such a poison pill for a relationship. And it 
does kind of boil down to trust. And I guess, you know, if you dig deep enough into the source of 
all of that, you end up landing in childhood. Not always, but I suspect often.
Vienna: Yeah, right. Not always. And of course I, I recognize that not every wound of ours gets 
created in childhood. It's just the framework that I use when I'm doing my work. But yeah, the 
breach of trust is so brutal because we all know that it's so hard to work our way back from it. 
And you're right, we have the big ones, right, the obvious ones, and infidelity, somebody 
gambling away your education fund or something like that.
But then we also have the things like parents who make promises that they don't follow through 
on. And it might feel small, but that's something that starts to teach a child whether or not they 
can trust another person to follow through on what they're saying. 
I think when it's our parents or the adults who are in our parental roles, who teach us that we 
are not worthy, who communicate to us that we are not a priority, or that you can't trust other 
people, or that you're not safe in the world. This is a really hard thing to come back from 
because as kids, we look to our parents, to the adults as truth. 
We don't have the capacity to process properly, right? If I'm not worthy in the eyes of my parent, 
then there's no way that I'm worthy in the eyes of anybody else. If I can't trust the people who 
are supposed to love me, protect me, nurture me, guide me…
Then what do you mean I'm supposed to trust other people? That's a real conundrum for a lot of 
folks.
music 

How do you draw the line between self love… and self-indulgence?

I’ll ask Vienna… after a short break.
 

MIDROLL 1

Music

Sean: You know, I'll be honest, like one of the things I've always found sort of off-putting about 
the world of wellness literature is a kind of obsession with self-care and self-fulfillment, you 
know, taken too far, I do think that can become self-indulgent when often I think what we really 
need in order to be happy is to be less self-involved.
But I think you, you make a pretty compelling case that the absence of self-love manifests in 
some pretty toxic ways in our relationships. And maybe you could just say a bit about that.
Vienna: Yeah, I mean, I think the absence of self-love really intersects with these wounds, 
right? Like when you don't feel deserving or good enough that there were conditions for love, 
right? I needed to perform, be perfect, be a people pleaser, be the comic relief, whatever it is in 
order to get connection, attention, love, presence, et cetera.
Right? And maybe I should just name worthiness, belonging, prioritization, trust and safety are 
the five wounds that I go over. What we'll see is that those things strip away at our confidence. 
They strip away at the self, right? This belief that I belong as I am. So with a belonging wound, a 
lot of times families have this narrative, like this is what it looks like to be a part of this family. 
This is what we believe, this is what we do, this is how we show up in the world. 
And some of that is beautiful, right? The traditions that we have with a family, that might be 
lovely, but other parts of that are where we're asked to trade our authenticity for attachment. Dr. 
Gabor Mate talks about that being our two lifelines, attachment and authenticity.
But when, when attachment is threatened, a child will trade authenticity in an instant in order to 
survive. And so we start to see how all of these things strip away from our capacity to hold 
ourselves in high regard, or even just regard. To pick ourselves up and believe that we are 
deserving of, to believe that we can just be ourselves, and that that is enough, to believe that we 
are important in the world, to believe that there are people in this world whom we can trust, or to 
believe that there is care and concern for our overall well being. 
And so self-love to me is not, you know, sure you wanna throw in some bubble baths and yeah, 
those are great things for us from time to time. But I talk about self-love as the intersection of 
grace and compassion for the self, as well as accountability and ownership.
And we have to see ourselves as a part of the human experience, but we also need to take 
accountability and ownership. And when we don't do that, we're stuck. The self-critic is totally 
turned up right? That inner voice that just has a lot to say about who we are and what we're 
doing and doesn't seem to have any problems letting us know.
And so, like, we stay stuck in that space instead of moving to a place of agency, I think you said 
before. Yeah.
Sean: The question of authenticity, about how as children we often trade our authenticity for 
attachment, we start contorting ourselves very early. I certainly did for way longer than I should 
have for other people because that is the straightest line to acceptance. But that strategy does 
not work in the long run.
I think you're right that it becomes a problem in our relationships, right? I mean, there are, there 
are, there are many different versions of this. I, I have my own. To not make this all about me. 
There's a case in the book, it's the gay man from West Virginia who is closeted for years, and 
he moves to New York City and finds himself in a relationship with someone who's wrapped up 
in the party scene and he's like playing along, but it's not really what he wants. He wants a 
quieter life, but he's stuck performing this role because he thinks he has to in order to be 
accepted by his partner and probably by his social circle. But no one can maintain that kind of 
pose forever, right?
Like we gotta be who we are for the people we love, or they won't be able to love us and we 
won't be able to love ourselves.
Vienna: Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's right. All of this stuff is the bandaid. It can take us to a certain 
point. We can fake it. Okay. I'll be perfect and I can fake it for a little bit or, yeah. I'll trade 
authenticity and do what I need to do to fit in. Okay. We can fake it for a little bit, and it might 
give us the outcome that we want.
Maybe people give us validation or they might give us attention, or they might wanna spend 
time with us, but it ends. We cannot keep that up forever. And that's why I say it's so important 
for us to go into the origin pain. 
So for the, the man you're describing, he needed to spend time witnessing the pain about his 
family rejecting him. There were constraints there. His sexuality was something that they could 
not really comprehend from the south, very religious family, right? And so there were a lot of 
constraints there. And he overheard his mom after he had come out, say like, why is he ruining 
my life? You know, those like daggers that really, really hurt him and tore him apart.
And when we just scurry by that, right, when we just brute force our way through, when we 
white knuckle it, when we're just like, okay, I'm just gonna keep on going and not try to tend to 
the pain. What winds up happening is we maintain that I'm not worthy, that I'm not lovable, that 
I'm not a priority, that I do not fit in, that I don't belong, that I'm not safe, that there is nobody to 
trust in the world.
Those things just keep circulating and, you know, maintaining the pain. It was so important for 
people to come back into contact with the original pain that set all of these patterns in motion.
Sean: Hmm. We're both parents.
Vienna: Mm-hmm.
Sean: Having a kid is such a transformative event in the life of a couple. Everyone more or less 
understands that, but do you think we still underestimate just how much becoming a parent 
changes our relationships?
Vienna: Yeah, probably. I mean, I think you're right. In theory we're like, of course it does, but 
until you're in it, you know, we don't necessarily understand the strain that it has on you. 
Obviously we know that there are such beautiful parts to it, such expansive parts, and there's 
also really hard stuff that presents itself and yeah, I think we probably do underestimate, listen, 
I'm, and I know you too, we're, we're still in the early part of parenthood. I can tell how easy it is 
for resentment to present very early on when you step into parenthood. And I don't know if you 
experienced that too, but I think my husband and I, we have such a great team and that was still 
there. That piece of, are we doing things equally and who's contributing what? And you know 
how quick it is for resentment to start to creep in. 
And the expectations, you know, when we're doing this type of healing work too. Seeing 
yourself as parent and what that brings forward for you in terms of your relationship with your 
own, or, you know, thinking back to when you were a tiny human and how you want to offer a 
very different experience for them.
Or a similar experience, right? If you had a really great one. There's so many layers that start to 
reveal themselves, and until you're in the thick of it, I think it's hard to fully know what's gonna 
show up there.
Sean: Yeah, I think it really is true on some level that every couple is a story that they sort of 
believe together, and that story changes. It has to change, and it certainly changes when you 
become parents. You know, and I, again, I can only speak from personal experience, but what 
has happened for us is there's this kind of gradual evolution from being friends who sort of 
share life together.
And if you're not very careful, what you find yourself becoming is less that and more co-
managers of a household. And all your energy, and all your bandwidth and all your patience 
gets used up on this child. You know, especially when, when they're really young. You know, 
again, we have a three and a half year old and that means there's nothing left for each other, 
and so you become more reactive and more irritable and you start dumping some of those 
frustrations onto each other ‘cause there's nowhere else for it to go. 
And that has been one of the hardest things to reckon with and, and try to transcend. And there 
are good days and there are bad days, but the bad days are, are hard. [laff]
Vienna: They're hard, and I think it's interesting too because, depending on what type of 
wounds you might have, there are certain things that might activate us even more. So, for 
example, if you are a parent who has a prioritization wound, meaning you didn't feel important 
growing up, maybe you had a parent who was a workaholic, or maybe there were mental health 
challenges in the family system that took up the space, or addiction that took up the space.
If that's the wound, and then you have this third party come into the equation and then all of a 
sudden, the other partner is spending a lot of time with that third party — baby — and all of that 
love and connection is going there all of a sudden. Even though we can rationalize it and say, of 
course it's a baby.
This is what we do, yada, yada, yada. It doesn't mean that the wound isn't getting activated. 
Right? All of a sudden I am deprioritized now. 
Sean: Yeah.
Vienna: Or, if we have a worthiness wound. And so unless I am showing up as a perfect parent, 
because that's what I learned, that in order to be loved, right, I needed to be perfect. And now 
here I am in this new role where, oh my gosh, I have no idea what I'm doing. I feel nervous. I'm 
a little scared. I'm not sure I trust myself. All the things right.
Then it activates that piece, and so obviously every parent's journey is different, right? And the 
things that activate us within that space, and I'm not just saying in relation to the child. Within 
the coupleship too, you'll start to see like what are the things that make me most reactive here? 
Our reactivity, when we have strong reactions, it's a neon sign that directs us back to our 
wounds.
I'm pissed that I'm not getting time with my partner. I feel like you're prioritizing our child over 
me. Just noticing what's showing up is gonna remind us and tell us where we need to go spend 
more time.
Sean: The worthiness wound prompted a bit of tough reflection. You know, again, I, I was an 
only child. There weren't any siblings around, and I think part of the way I responded to that was 
this feeling of not quite having a tribe, you know, and having parents who were young and not 
always available. And so I think, the way I— that ended up manifesting for me is I became very 
sort of chameleonic, you know what I mean? Like I became very good at trying to fit in.
Vienna: Shape shifting.
Sean: Yeah. With as many different people as I could in order to, I don't know, get validation or 
just feel like I was part of a tribe. And you do that long enough and eventually you realize… oh, I 
never really actually settled my identity. I just kept playing with new ones in order to fit with the 
circumstances in which I found myself. That was a big revelation for me.
Vienna: And I think when you start your own family for the first time,
Sean: Oh yeah.
Vienna: Do I belong here? Can I be a part of something here? Even when it's partnership, 
right? There's that sense, and then you bring somebody else into the mix and you're like, wow, 
okay, what I had, and you've got the, the same equation now. Right? Now your child is an only 
child, and to think about what that reflects back to you and what am I creating, but also can I 
make space to feel a part of something here, as well?
Can I receive that? Right? Or am I finding ways to block that?
Sean: So if you were someone who is finding themselves stuck in some of these patterns of 
reactivity and you, you want to disrupt that pattern, is there any other concrete advice you can 
give people a, a practice or tool that they can draw on when they find themselves slipping into 
another one of these patterns and just kind of doing the same dance over and over again?
Vienna: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I love the question, and I think I said it earlier: What does this pattern 
serve?
Sean: Do you mean literally like, like pausing and kind of posing the question to yourself?
Vienna: Yeah. And you might not be able to do it in the moment. I think a lot of times when 
we're hot, there's not a lot of cooling down that can happen right away. So in a moment of 
reflection, whether that's a few hours later, the next day, the next week, or right now, before 
something even happens, right? To notice, like, what are the things that make me the most 
reactive?
What do the patterns in my life, the things that I want to change, what does this serve? Now, 
we're gonna say it doesn't serve anything. All it does is cause problems. All it does is cause 
disconnection. All it does is cause dysfunction in my relationships. But it still serves something. 
And my example that I shared before was, it served my need to protect myself.
It served my need that being right meant that I was safe. And so whatever it is that you're doing 
that you can't stand, that you're trying to change, it's doing something that your system thinks is 
for you. Does that make sense?
Sean: It does. One thing I started doing, and you could tell me if this is stupid. Um, and I'm 
working on this, but I kind of came to the conclusion, all right, look, I can't quite break these 
patterns in the sense of I can't quite do exactly what I want to do, what I know I should do.
So until, or, unless I can do that, what I will do is as soon as I can observe that, okay, we're on 
the brink of an interaction going sideways here, and I'm up in my head about it. I just said, you 
know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna walk away. What I'm not gonna do is escalate, right? I 
can't quite resolve this, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna just put a bow on this whole exchange.
Walk away. Then we could circle back later. But I can see that if I'm gonna keep participating in 
what's happening here, uh, I'm gonna do it in a way that's gonna make this worse, not better. So 
I'm just gonna, that's it. I'm gonna end it. Is that, um, obviously it's not a solution to any of these 
fundamental problems, but is it…
Vienna: it's a pause.
Sean: I mean, is that better than just continuing on with the, with the pattern?
Vienna: Well, remember, earlier on in this chat we talked about that it's not just about us, it's 
about the other person that is in the equation with us, right? That they also have a history, that 
they also have wounds, and so: yes, individually, this is a pause, and probably a pretty good 
one. You know that it's gonna escalate. That never ends well, and so I'd rather not escalate. 
But what we're missing is whether or not you stepping away activates something in the other 
person. And if we don't talk about that, right, if there isn't an agreement, then that's something 
that can cause a different type of a rupture. 
So for example, if the other person has an abandonment wound, or they feel like you stepping 
away doesn't honor their emotional safety, for example, or they feel deprioritized when you say, 
I'm outta here, I'm not gonna keep having this conversation. And all of a sudden that activates a 
prioritization wound, right? Like that's what's so important and that's so relationship-specific, it's 
to say, what's gonna work for the two of you? Right? And how do you co-create that with the 
idea and understanding of what's at play so that we can tend to, and like care for the other 
person's experience while also caring for our own. 
So yeah, it, it sounds like it's a good pause for you, but I would get curious about whether it's a 
good pause for the other person too.
Sean: Probably not and we, we're… I'm working on it.

music 

We’ve got to take one last quick break. But when we come back… 

Vienna’s seen a lot of couples. So, what do people regret the most… 
when they look back on their relationships?
 

MIDROLL 2

Music

Sean: You counsel a lot of couples,
Vienna: Yes.
Sean: Some of them figure it out and stay together, some of them don't.
Vienna: Mm-hmm.
Sean: In your experience, what do you find that people regret the most when they reflect back 
on their relationships?
Vienna: Hmm. Probably that they don't come to it sooner. You know, like that the, that they 
don't come to the awarenesses sooner.
Sean: That they don't start working on their problem sooner, you mean?
Vienna: Yeah, and I, cuz I think what's important is that we're not so hard and difficult on 
ourselves. Like a lot of times people will come in and they're like, I know I'm starting way late. 
And it's like, no, like you're, you, you know, we're stepping into something when we're ready for 
it.
And I think it's important, again, to have that grace and compassion for ourselves instead of like, 
oh, my life or my relationships could have been so different 10 years ago. And it's like, sure, you 
know, that that could have been true, but, here we are. You know, that doesn't really serve 
anything for us to just think that way and blame ourselves, but I think that's one of the things 
that people struggle with is, oh, I wish that I had been readier to confront this sooner.
Because the beauty of this work is that we gain internal peace. It changes our relationships and 
the quality of our relationships, certainly. But there is a beautiful internal peace that happens 
when we do this work. 
When people get a taste of that and they're like, huh, I don't have to be in suffering all the time. I 
understand why that regret can pop up.
Sean: Every now and then, um, usually after some kind of stupid fight, I'll imagine… How would 
I feel if my wife left right now? Right? We got in this fight and she just got in the car and left, and 
something tragic happened.
Vienna: Mm-hmm.
Sean: You know, like a car accident or something. I mean, my, my mother passed away, um, 
about two and a half years ago from a car accident very suddenly.
So that's still very much on my mind, that possibility. Um, and I'm not trying to be dark here or 
too heavy. I, I'm really not. 
I guess I'm trying to make a point, you know, like… if that were to happen, What I know, absol– 
what I know more than anything I've ever known in my whole life is that I would never forgive 
myself for having wasted the time we had on such ridiculous, trivial nonsense that will appear so 
trivial and ridiculous less than 24 hours later.
Vienna: Yeah, but the trivial stuff is connected to our pain. 
Sean: Right.
Vienna: We don't do stupid shit just because it's fun. You know? We don't fight about the 
toothpaste cap and the toilet, you know, just the stupid, you know, examples that we've had for 
so long, right? It's like no one's doing that because we actually care about that.
Sean: It's never about that, right? The thing you're fighting about is almost never the thing 
you're fighting about. 
Vienna: Right?
So this trivial surface level stuff is connected to legitimate pain that we carry. You know, I've 
worked over 20,000 hours of individuals, couples, families, in therapy, and this is what I have 
seen over and over and over again. My personal life and my professional life. It points us to 
these wounds. And when we can tend to those wounds, then we can begin to create those 
changes.
You know, you said something before about the change that you would like to see. This is what 
I want it to look like, and I think there's an inquiry there about what would you need to believe in 
order for that to happen? 
Sean: Yeah.
Vienna: What do you need to believe about yourself in order for that to actually happen? 
There's so much that can birth from that.
Sean: So if someone's listening to this or they, they read your book and discover for 
themselves, yeah, okay, I've got a worthiness wound, or I have a safety wound, or whatever the 
deal is, right? They start with a problem they're having and they can trace it back to their history. 
Well, what do they do next?
What's the next move? Concretely, right? Like, okay, you have this knowledge, right? But 
knowing and doing are not the same thing. 
Vienna: That’s right.
Sean: So what's the next move?
Vienna: So, I walk the reader through a four-step process. My origin healing practice, where the 
first part is about naming and identifying the wound. Do not be surprised if you have multiple, so 
you're naming what wound or wounds you resonate with and identify with. 
The second part of the practice is witnessing, so… yeah, the part of the self, again, that just 
wants to move on. We don't tend, we don't acknowledge and see ourselves very well, and the 
witnessing step is about that. Now, I'm a big believer in witnessing the self. I'm also a big 
believer in having another human whom we trust, who loves us, somebody we're safe with, do 
witnessing as well.
What's really important for people to hear is that the person or people who contributed to the 
origin wound do not need to participate in the witnessing of it now. They don't need to 
participate in the healing of it in any way. In fact, I would say probably more times than not, I 
hear people say like, yep, my parent just can't acknowledge it, or they're super defensive, or all 
they do is explain why they did what they did. Right? And like, and people keep going there. 
over and over and over again. Well, maybe if I say it this way, or maybe if I write them a letter 
instead of speaking it to them, or maybe if I'm really kind, or maybe if I get really angry, like what 
way will it get through?
And I think sometimes when we get caught in this space of needing the person that we so badly 
want to acknowledge it, to be the person who has to do it, we get trapped in this cycle and can't 
find a way forward. 
And so oftentimes witnessing the younger self, I remember when I was, gosh, I must have been 
like seven or eight years old. I would find these like sneaky ways to pick up the telephone and 
listen in on my parents' conversations, or I'd perch myself at the top of the steps and there was 
like a little opening where I could listen in to the conversation that my mom was having on the 
phone, you know, becoming this detective and trying to figure out who's telling the truth or 
what's going on.
I needed that information and I remember the first time that I really closed my eyes and kind of 
transported myself as an adult, witnessing from afar, you know, if you were seeing it on a movie 
screen, uh, it was maybe a few feet away from my seven, eight year old self perched atop those 
stairs, but I just got there and I was watching her.
Watching her listen in, watching her absorb the fighting, all of the conflict, all the anger, the 
yelling, and just seeing her, you know, again, I didn't have siblings. Neither of my parents ever 
remarried. There were no stepparents or anybody else. There's just no validation, right? And so 
there was something really important about being able to witness what I had gone through 
through my adult clear lenses today. And so that was so important for me to do, and it's been 
really important for people I work with to do that witnessing or to have a loving partner do that as 
well. 
The third part is grieving. Woof. People are like, oh, I don't want to, when in doubt, grieve more, 
when stuck. Grieve more.
Sean: But that will sound to a lot of people like wallowing. Right? What's the difference? 
Because wallowing seems unproductive, but grieving in the sense you mean it is the opposite.
Vienna: Yeah, right. It's very intentional. This is never about us wallowing, getting stuck, being 
in some type of victim position. This is about feeling what needs to be felt.
Sean: Right.
Vienna: And sometimes I think when we have an aversion to wallowing or feeling, we're like, 
Nope, I don't need to, you know, I'm just gonna, again, white knuckle my way through 
something.
And what we find is that grieving is so important for us to allow ourselves to come into contact 
with the emotion that is there, what was lost. The sadness that is held around what those 
experiences might have been like and to allow ourselves to come into contact with the pain. 
And then the fourth step is pivoting. I don't believe that we pivot before we witness and grieve. 
You know, I think that the pivot, right, which is about, I don't know if you've ever done cross-
country skiing.
Sean: I, I tried and…
Vienna: Okay.
Sean: …I took them off after 10 minutes, threw 'em away and grabbed my snowboard.
Vienna: Yeah, makes sense. But you know, the idea of, you know, if a track is already laid,
Sean: Yeah.
Vienna: It's so much easier. I mean, it's hard anyway, but it's easier than when you are in fresh 
powder. And the pivot is really about, okay, I'm jumping off the thing that is so familiar, the 
pattern, right? And when I have witnessed and grieved the pause between stimulus and 
response, right?
There's more space for us to connect with that. We see, we are aware of things, and then it's in 
that moment that we can make a decision about staying in the loop or exiting and trying 
something different.
Sean: I love that. It's so important, that pause between stimulus and response, that is the worst 
feeling for me. And even what you said a second ago about, it's not about feeling yourself to be 
some kind of victim. Like, I'm really sensitive to that man. I, I reflect back – yeah… I had this 
problem as a, as a kid and my parents were emotionally unavailable in this way and that way 
and whatever, and, but I don't wanna get trapped in this narrative that strips me of my ability to 
do better, to do otherwise.
But you still have to, you have to reckon with these things, you have to face them. You know, 
again, the cliche, the only way out is through.
Vienna: Right. It is. It is the pathway to our freedom. Right, and, and there's such truth to that. 
And you know, certain cliches are cliches ‘cause there's truth to them, right? Like that. The only 
way out is through. And I think when we build up these muscles of awareness of what's 
happening in this moment is not just about this moment.
What's happening in this moment is every moment that predates this moment that is familiar to 
what's playing out here. When we tend to that. Then pain is like, okay, like, almost as if you 
could make pain or your wounds a different entity, externalize it, put it outside of you for a 
moment. Pain is not out to destroy us.
They're not like, ha ha, ha, ha, I can't wait to fuck your life ove– you know, it's like, that's not 
what it's trying to do. It's there to be tended to. It wants acknowledgement, it wants to be seen, it 
wants to be heard, it wants to be honored, and that's not what we do. We just try to go on with 
our lives, skip over it, or we don't tend to it properly.
And that's the beauty is that, once we do, then pain is able to say, okay, I don't need to keep 
bringing you back into this. That's why we wind up in the same patterns over and over again. 
Pain's like, I have to find clever ways to keep bringing you back into contact with this thing. So 
I'm gonna find ways to do that.
Sean: Yeah.
Vienna: There is something so profound about watching it play out and having people care for 
the pain and remember it. You know, like, it doesn't just go out of sight and it doesn't mean that 
you come to some, you know, completion place or you know, you never come into contact with 
the pain again, we know that grief is an ongoing thing and we will face it every time it presents 
itself, and it's more that the charge changes, right? That the charge lessens. And when the 
charge lessens, we have more control. We have more agency as opposed to the pain having 
more control.
Sean: This is an unfair, probably impossible question, but I'm gonna ask it anyway ‘cause I'm 
annoying like that sometimes. 
Vienna: Okay.
Sean: How do we know when to walk away from a relationship?
Vienna: Mm-hmm. Yeah, you know… that question in and of itself, outsources the answer.
Sean: What does that mean?
Vienna: You are asking somebody outside of you to make that decision, and I know that you're 
asking this for the general public, but I think that that's what people do, right, is they say, how 
will I know? instead of going inwards and spending time with all of the parts and the pieces that 
are specific to that individual and that relationship because how one person knows is entirely 
different than how another person knows.
And I think a lot of times it's so hard to be responsible for that decision. There's something nice 
about somebody else telling us that, like, yeah, well if they do X, Y, and Z, then you should 
definitely leave. 
To actually own the decision based on what is true about your life and what's true about what's 
playing out in your relationship…It's not a cop out, my answer. It's not a cop out, I promise, but I, 
that's where I would turn somebody for us to then begin to have the conversations of what is 
happening in that person's internal world and story.
Sean: I mean, look, probably if nothing else, um, you know, a relationship is a dynamic between 
two people, but
Vienna: Mm-hmm.
Sean: Simply doing the work to figure out what your problems are, what's coming from you, and 
discerning that from just the shit you're projecting onto your partner is very helpful. At least then 
you can have maybe a clearer view of not just what's wrong, but what's solvable.
Vienna: Absolutely. You know, I get a lot of questions about, well, what if, what if a partner 
doesn't want to look at their origin wounds or they like, definitely don't wanna talk about their 
family? 
And in the best case scenario we have people who do. That's our best case scenario is that 
people are like, gimme this book, pull up my sleeves, let's get into it. 
But we can affect a lot on our own, right? You can never make the horse drink from the well. 
You cannot force a person into this space, and I would not recommend that. But what I would 
recommend is doing your own. 
Sometimes we start living by example. Sometimes we start revealing, oh my gosh, I just had 
this aha, and what this revealed to me is X, Y, and Z.
Those things can sometimes shift a system in pretty significant ways, and when you stay on 
your own path there's clarity that will come from that.
Sean: This conversation and the book. It really did hit me at an opportune time and I read it 
very, very closely, um, and took it on board. So, thanks.
Vienna: Thank you.
Sean: The book is, once again, The Origins of You: How Breaking Family Patterns Can Liberate 
the Way We Live and Love. Vienna Pharaon, thanks so much for being here.
Vienna: Thank you for having me.

I told Vienna before we actually started recording that I had to be a little personal and 
speak from my own experiences, because that’s all I know. Obviously, my experiences 
are my own, and we’re all living our own particular circumstances, but there are 
common threads.
Most of us are trying to navigate relationships, a lot of us are trying to be parents, a lot 
of us are struggling with our own unhelpful, counterproductive patterns. And maybe 
some of this helped.
