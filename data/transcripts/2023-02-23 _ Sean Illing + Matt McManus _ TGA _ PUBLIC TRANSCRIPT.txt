TITLE: Taking Nietzsche seriously

SUBTITLE: The 19th-century German philosopher has a history of being misread, 
misunderstood, and misinterpreted. And yet his insights can still have resonance today — 
but we have to grapple with the unsettling things in his work.

DESCRIPTION:
Sean Illing talks with political science professor Matt McManus about the political thought of 
Friedrich Nietzsche, the 19th-century German philosopher with a complicated legacy, 
despite his crossover into popular culture. They discuss how Nietzsche's work has been 
interpreted — and misinterpreted — since his death in 1900, how his radical political views 
emerge from his body of work, and how we can use Nietzsche's philosophy in order to 
interpret some key features of our contemporary politics.

INTRO:

CLIP: passage from Nietzsche’s Ecce Homo VO:
I know my fate. Some day my name will be linked to the memory of something 
monstrous, of a crisis as yet unprecedented on earth, the most profound collusion of 
consciences, a decision conjured up against everything hitherto believed, demanded, 
hallowed. I am not a man… I am dynamite.

Sean Illing: Those are the words of Friedrich Nietzsche… Nietzsche’s philosophy has been a 
huge influence in my life. If you listen to the show, you already know that. But the guy is full of 
contradictions.

He’s in the rare echelon of philosophers who've managed to cross over into popular culture. 

CLIP: from Little Miss Sunshine:
STEVE CARRELL: Is that Nietzsche? You don’t speak because of Friedrich Nietzsche? 
… Far out.

That’s from Little Miss Sunshine, an Oscar-winning 2006 movie. For a 19th century German 
philosopher, that’s pretty mainstream…

And yet, when it comes to his actual philosophy — his ideas are hard to pin down. He wrote in 
many different voices and in many different (and often contradictory) ways ….

Nietzsche challenged readers to live heroically … To transcend the banalities of a sick, 
decadent culture … The irony of course is that he himself was very sick … And near the end of 
his life, while staying in Italy… he suffered a full mental breakdown.

He never recovered.

The contradictions pile up in Nietzsche’s work, too. In books like Beyond Good & Evil, he tosses 
away most of traditional morality …   But he’s also trying to warn us about why this is such a 
catastrophe for civilization… That has something to do with what he called “the death of God,” 
and trust me, we’ll get into that later.

He’s notorious for the concept of the Übermensch — or “Super-man”... this is an idea the Nazis 
would later borrow to suit their own sordid political goals … And while it’s never entirely clear 
what Nietzsche meant by that word, it’s obvious it had nothing to do with antisemitism or 
eugenics.

So, Nietzsche is a bit of a mystery … But he is, without question, a radical and inspiring thinker, 
someone who anticipated some of our modern crises better than anyone else … And yet, 
because of how he wrote (and often what he wrote), he can, in the hands of a certain kind of 
reader, lead to some dark places…

But… he remains an essential thinker for our time, … And it’s up to us to resolve the 
contradictions.

My guest today is Matt McManus. He’s a lecturer at the University of Michigan, and he’s the 
editor of a new essay collection, called Nietzsche and the Politics of Reaction.

As McManus reads him, Nietzsche is a political thinker – and a right-wing one, at that. He says, 
if we want to really understand Nietzsche, we’re going to have to grapple with that fact. 

McManus thinks that Nietzsche is the ultimate reactionary, and in that respect he thinks that we 
can use Nietzsche to understand our politics today. And so I wanted to talk to him about how 
this weird, brilliant, singular philosopher can shed light not just on the far right – but on 
progressives, too.
But… in order to do that, we’re gonna have to take Nietzsche seriously… and confront what he 
has to say, even when we don’t like what he’s saying.

Sean Illing: Matt McManus, welcome to the show.
Matt McManus: Yeah, thanks. I’m looking forward to this.
Sean: I think a Nietzsche episode is long overdue for this show. This one is tough for me 
because I love Nietzsche. I mean, he's one of the great intellectual influences of my life, and I 
continue to think he understood the crisis of modernity better and sooner than anyone, and yet 
there is this dark side to Nietzsche, and if you take him too far too seriously, it can lead to some 
pretty ugly places.
We'll get into what I mean by that, but I just wanted to kind of throw my cards on the table right 
at the start of this thing.
Matt: Oh, hey, listen. I love the guy also. I mean, I sometimes get annoyed emails from people 
being like, why are you attacking such a great thinker? Why are you trying to cancel Nietzsche? 
I, I'm not trying to cancel Nietzsche at all. I started reading him when I must have been like, 17 
or 18 years old. I was raised Roman Catholic going through the very cliched crisis, and I just 
thought his work was electrifying.
Right? Changed my life in a lot of ways.
Sean: I mean, come on, dude. That's so cliche.
Matt: Oh, a hundred percent.
Sean: Did Nietzsche cause the crisis or, or was the crisis well underway by the time you 
happened upon him?
Matt: Oh no, it was well underway at that point. I mean, part of it was prompted by politics 
because a lot of the Catholics that I knew and grew up with were very conservative. Quite a few 
of them were very homophobic, uh, which I didn't like at all. Uh, but you know, part of it was just 
also metaphysical. Like, I started asking questions like, well, does God actually exist?
If God exists, you know, what form does he take? If there is no God, what does that say? And 
you know, I didn't know shit about anything at that point, so I just did the typical thing, which is 
go on the early internet, you know, this is just around when Wikipedia is coming up, being like, 
who answers these kinds of questions?
And they're like, oh, there's this guy. Write a book called Beyond Good and Evil and The 
Antichrist. And so I went out to the store. The nice thing about Nietzsche too is because he's so 
popular, you can get him at any bookstore, right? So I just picked up, I have the same copy 
actually, Beyond Good and Evil, Twilight of the Idols, and The Antichrist for Penguin and uh, like 
you, it just rocked my world, right?
Like I'd never thought about things like that before. I didn't understand everything. You know, I 
was 18 years old, but there was this real sense that there was something important going on 
that was opening my eyes to ways of looking at things that I had never even considered before. 
So I'm very grateful for that.
But like a lot of people, he would sometimes say these things about slaves and women and 
lower cultures and your eyes just kind of drift over that and you don't really pay too much 
attention to it. And you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that we do need to pay attention 
to that kind of stuff. So it's been a learning process for me also.
Sean: Yeah, that's the thing about Nietzsche, right? From page to page, you can swing from, oh 
my God, that's the most brilliant insight I've ever encountered. And then on the next page it's 
like… ooh, yikes. Did he really just say that?
Matt: And you're like, uh, I'm not really sure that I, uh, can get on board with that one.
Sean: Yeah. You know, you, you edited this anthology of essays about Nietzsche and you've 
just completed a monograph that is at least partly about Nietzsche.
Matt: It's a history of right wing thought, generally, he figures largely in it though. I think actually 
he has four whole sections dedicated to him –  more than almost everybody else.
Sean: So what's the motivation there? Why do you think we need to engage with someone like 
Nietzsche at this political moment?
Matt: Well, I think there are two reasons. One good and one bad. The good reason is like you, I 
think that Nietzsche offers a profound diagnosis of the problems of modernity that anyone can 
profitably learn from, including wherever you stand on the political spectrum. And we can talk a 
lot about what I think Nietzsche offers as a kind of positive program for our progressive or liberal 
thinkers going forward.
But the bad reason is, that for a long time, uh, it was expected that Nietzsche really just didn't 
even have a politics, or if he did that, it was a pretty minor aspect of his thinking. What we've 
seen is, of course, that he does have a politics, uh, and it's an extremely right wing politics. And 
understanding that it not only helps us gain a better appreciation of his own thought, but it 
allows us to see how it is that he's influenced generations of right and hard right thinkers, 
including many who are very active today.
Sean: Yeah. You know, the idea that Nietzsche was anti-political or apolitical was always so 
bizarre to me. I mean, it's true. He spends a lot of time fretting about culture, but for him, culture 
and politics are very clearly bound up with one another. And so his concerns about culture are 
very much tethered to his concerns about politics.
So you just simply can't separate those things out.
Matt: My friend Hugo Drochon wrote a book called Nietzsche’s Great Politics, and that's actually 
a line that comes from Ecce Homo, right? Uh, his autobiography, where Nietzsche actually 
explicitly says, it's only with me that great politics will finally enter into the world, or will begin 
again — sometimes it's translated variably.
And by great politics he means… war that the earth has never seen before. Quite prophetic, if 
you think that World War I and World War II were upcoming, right? 
Sean: Oh yeah.
Matt: And this isn't something that he looks upon with exclusively terror; it's something that he is 
really anticipating because it will provide a kind of edifying or purifying function over the face of 
the earth.
So it's very hard once you recognize these statements to then go back and say, you know, he 
was just a bohemian intellectual who was offering critiques of art or psychological advice.
Sean: It may help to set the table a little bit for the rest of the conversation to just ask you how 
people have interpreted Nietzsche over the years. He wasn't terribly well-known when he was 
alive and writing, and he died in 1900. Then he, he ends up getting appropriated by the Nazis 
for sordid reasons that we don't have to get into here.
And then later in the 20th century, he becomes a kind of radical proto-postmodern progressive 
darling. I mean, is it possible to give us some of the broad strokes here in terms of how he has 
been read over the years? Why has this guy had so many philosophical lives?
Matt: I think that there are a number of different things to be said about this. Nietzsche, early in 
his own career, actually enjoyed tremendous academic prominence, something that people 
don't know, but as a philologist, right? Um..
Sean: And super quickly – what’s philology, for those of us who don’t know?
Matt: Generally, the study of ancient languages, but really examining the roots of various words 
in ancient languages. And this of course contributes to Nietzsche's early interest in things like 
Greek philosophy. And people thought he was a Wunderkind, somebody who was going to 
revolutionize the discipline, and great expectations were put on him. And then he releases his, 
uh, first book, The Birth of Tragedy.
And pretty much the whole philological community is like, what is this? Right? This is not 
philology, this isn't quite philosophy. It's not even art commentary. It's just weird. And his 
academic position pretty much craters at that point. Undeservedly, ‘cause it's a minor 
masterpiece, I think. He wrote better books later on, but it's a very interesting text.
Then, you know, he spends the rest of his life flirting with a bunch of different movements. Won't 
get too much into them. He's only really gaining a little tiny little bit of attention near the end of 
his life, where, in an important correspondence, he's chatting with one of the first lecturers in 
Denmark who's talking about Nietzsche's work.
And this is important because the lecturer says, I think of your philosophy as a kind of 
aristocratic radicalism. And Nietzsche says, that's exactly right. You know, that's what I'm aiming 
for. And then of course, after Nietzsche collapsed into madness, He enjoyed this extraordinary 
intellectual prominence, unfortunately, amongst a lot of the worst kinds of people, particularly on 
the political right where the Nazis appropriated him and almost transformed them into their 
philosopher.
German imperialists did the same in the First World War where they would hand out copies of 
Thus Spoke Zarathustra to German soldiers on the front. So then after the First and Second 
World War, there was a real effort by people like Walter Kaufmann to rehabilitate him, 
deservedly, right, for English speaking audiences.
Sean: And we could just say, just, just real quickly, Walter Kaufmann is the sort of foremost 
translator of Nietzsche for American audiences.
Matt: Absolutely. I mean, if you've read a book by Nietzsche, odds are it's the Kauffman 
translation and you know, he's a great translator. He also wrote a very good book on Nietzsche 
as a Psychologist, but that's kind of itself telling because the way that Kaufmann tried to 
rehabilitate Nietzsche's reputation amongst the Anglosphere especially, was by presenting him 
as a kind of bohemian existential psychologist who more or less doesn't have any bearing on 
politics at all.
And this was pretty effective in convincing people that they could read Nietzsche safely while 
not having to align him with these far-right movements that he had once been so associated 
with.
Sean: Yeah, he's not fascist. He's just a little weird.
Matt: Yeah, exactly. He's a little cranky and eccentric around the edges, right? Then starting, 
you know, in the 1950s and really climaxing in the sixties and seventies, he's appropriated by 
generations of French intellectuals, mostly leftists, who find all kinds of interesting stuff to do 
with his work.
So much so that by the 1970s, you even find people like Michel Foucault, just saying, I am a 
Nietzschean. Right? With a hundred different qualifications to that of course. But this led to the 
kind of presupposition, even amongst conservative thinkers, that Nietzsche was fundamentally a 
kind of bohemian liberal, maybe even radical intellectual.
And now we've kind of come full circle, uh, since a new generation of right and far-right thinkers 
have really rediscovered him and reinterpreted him, I think more appropriately as a right-wing 
thinker. His politics are not Foucault’s politics. Uh, and they're definitely not Kaufmann's kind of 
soft psychologism. He is very committed to aristocratic radicalism and that’s a pretty nasty thing, 
especially if you hold to liberal and progressive views like I do.
Sean: So let's get into the ideas. As you point out, Nietzsche is one of those rare philosophers 
who has managed to enter into the pop cultural imagination. That's partly why so many people 
have opinions about him, despite having never read him. And the thing I hear the most about 
Nietzsche is he's the guy who was a nihilist, who gleefully pronounced that God is dead.
That trope triggers the hell out of me. I, I don't know about you, Matt, but we should clear this up 
right now because I think understanding this part of his thought, what he actually meant here, is 
really essential to making sense of everything else that comes out of his mouth later. So what 
did Nietzsche mean by God is dead?
Matt: One thing that it doesn't mean is that Nietzsche is there to kill God or offer a scholastic 
rebuttal of conventional proofs for God's existence, right? What's important when he says, “God 
is dead and we have killed him,” is that Nietzsche is describing something that has already 
occurred, even if people aren't really acknowledging it.
Or more importantly, even if they're not prepared to deal with the implications of what it is that 
they've done. So the crisis that he's talking about is really the crisis in European Christianity that 
he sees as emerging in the middle of the 19th century when the natural sciences, which 
themselves were an offspring of the Christian worldview, basically killed their father and 
established a new secular view of the universe. 
But he is very concerned that it's going to generate many new kinds of outlooks and new kinds 
of approaches to the world, many of which are going to be sick, unhealthy, and lead people to 
be profoundly either unhappy or potentially even worse – to seek happiness in the most crass, 
venal places.
Sean: I mean, that's sort of what's so ironic here, right? Like when, when Nietzsche is talking 
about the death of God, it's really a lamentation. You know, he's saying like, yo, yo people, do 
you see what we've done here? Do you understand the crisis this is going to unleash? We are 
absolutely not prepared for what is about to happen – or for what has already happened, 
actually.
It's so different from this notion that he was sort of dancing on God's grave.
Matt: Oh, absolutely. One of the things that I find frustrating about... say the Richard Dawkins 
types. Richard Dawkins famously had a bus that would go around the UK…
CLIP [here and here; a news story from 2009]
NEWSMAN: London’s iconic red buses will soon display the message that God does not 
exist. The plan is to have thirty buses carrying signs that say: There’s probably no God, 
now stop worrying and enjoy your life. The campaign has the support of prominent 
atheist Professor Richard Dawkins.
DAWKINS: It’s funny, and it gets people to talk about it. It gets people to think.
Matt: That's a very crude, simplistic, almost banal atheism. Right? ‘Cause it almost tries to 
ignore religion and the history of religion and the way that it contributed to our very basic moral 
values, and say, Now that we don't believe in God, we'll just carry on like everything was going 
on before. We'll just take this little bit out of that. 
Whatever you can say about Nietzsche and his approach to Christianity, he took it extremely 
seriously. He did not ignore religion. If anything, he was trying to develop what you might call an 
active atheism or even an active antitheism. 
There are some remarkable things that come out of his work from that, but it's really a testament 
to his creativity and honesty that he took this kind of issue as seriously as he did, and really 
dedicated his life to trying to solve the problems that he thought were thrown up from this.
Even if I think, um, most of his solutions were quite repelling.
Sean: Yeah, he has this startling line. And like so many of his lines, it packs so much into a few 
words. He writes, ever since Copernicus man has been rolling away from the center toward X, 
it's getting at this idea that humanity's self-understanding of its place in the cosmos, right? Our 
understanding of our own creaturely significance… that starts to melt away with Copernicus, 
when we realize we're actually not the center of things. 
And then it finally gets extinguished by Darwin when we realize, oh, we're just a random product 
of blind, impersonal forces. And that is a gigantic event in human history.
Matt: Absolutely, right? It implies fundamentally that there's nothing all that significant about 
human life. And that consequently any kind of meaning we attribute to it has to be ours for the 
making. But I think it's also just important to stress that even his approach to antitheism was 
extraordinarily creative and innovative, and has been of great influence even to theologians 
going forward.
For instance, it can be very tempting to see natural science as kind of the antithesis of 
Christianity. What's remarkable about Nietzsche is he says that actually, modern science has its 
basis in this Christian ethic that you must always search after the truth and you must be 
relentlessly honest in that pursuit, which could also trace back to Plato, for example.
And he says, this led to a lethal situation where in one of his most striking comments, he says, 
one day Christians were compelled to ask the horrifying question, which is to ask the question 
against themselves, right? Is the Christian ethic about truth that I buy into itself true? And that's 
where all the kind of problems start to begin, ‘cause this is where you start to see the scientific 
method, that emerges from this Christian outlook, turn inwards.
I don't know whether this is entirely true as a kind of unpacking of the basis of modern science 
and its association with antitheism, but it's a really striking creative claim. And again, very 
contrary to cruder atheists like a Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens who just say, you know, 
science emerged, had nothing to do with religion and then destroyed religion.
We don't need it anymore.
Sean: So if God is dead wasn't a celebration, and it wasn’t, Nietzsche wasn't a champion of 
nihilism. He was. He was diagnosing it. So in terms of the story we want to tell here about his 
legacy, why was the death of God such a cataclysmic political event for him? Like, why did he 
think we really need to grapple with this?
Matt: Well, this brings us to the roots of his aristocratic radicalism, and it's a very complicated 
question, so I'll try to unpack it as simply as I can. 
He believes that ultimately the basis of most conventionally egalitarian systems, uh, including 
liberalism, democracy, and socialism, ultimately is this Christian ethic, right?
Think about Thomas Jefferson saying all men are created equal. Didn't really believe that, 
obviously, ‘cause he had slaves, right? But still a very inspiring statement. Nietzsche says, at its 
root, this comes from the lie, he calls it, of equality of souls that you find in Christianity, because 
according to the Christian outlook, all human beings are sinners.
All of us are finite, and all of us are equally loved and equally responsible before the throne of 
God. Once you take that away, what you find is something that looks a lot more like a kind of 
socially Darwinian universe, where Nietzsche says, of course, there are fundamental 
inequalities between people, just like there are certain kinds of fundamental inequalities 
between animals.
There are some animals that are brought into the world destined to die because they're too sick 
and they're not gonna be able to survive. And there's nothing wrong with acknowledging that. 
It's just a kind of natural fact that we need to learn to accept. And this is again, what's eventually 
going to lead to his convictions about aristocratic radicalism, which he sees as the necessary 
substitute for Christian egalitarianism.
Sean: Right. So, it's this idea that our whole notion of, of absolute moral truth was tethered to 
God. So the real problem wasn't that, everyone is now suddenly on the road to atheism. The 
problem for him is that we are still clinging to these absolute values about good and evil, about, 
as you were saying, the fundamental equality of human beings.
But the foundations for these original claims had dropped out beneath us.
Matt: Once you take God away, the notion that human life has any kind of dignity or any kind of 
intrinsic value at all, vanishes with it. And Nietzsche is very critical of people, let's say Immanuel 
Kant who think that you can somehow sectorize a notion of dignity and say that each individual 
life has an intrinsic worth, even if we don't necessarily buy into God and he thinks this is why 
Kant, for example, needs to bring God back in, even after his critical thought had destroyed the 
possibility of proving God's existence, uh, cuz it's so important morally. 
Uh, and again, he says, once you deny the idea that life has any intrinsic value, let alone that 
each person's life is of equal value relative to everyone else's, this much more competitive, 
diverse, uh, and quite frankly, brutal world, where you have to will value to your life, into being, 
through your own efforts.
Sean: And it is worth saying that the claim here wasn't that there could be no morality or truth 
without God. He’s saying the moral order that shaped our civilization that had collapsed. And 
that was a political crisis as much as anything else. And this is so important for Nietzsche, partly 
because he thinks it reopens this question of what humanity actually is.
And he's trying to force this confrontation with this crisis. And given how the 20th Century 
unfolded, it is unnerving to revisit some of his predictions about, you know, quote wars to 
determine the future of mankind, right? Like, the destruction of established religion for him 
wasn't the end of religion.
This is the beginning of nihilism. Nihilism was what happens when our, to use his language, our 
highest values, lose their value, lose their ground. And that sort of sets us adrift in this, in this 
moral abyss.
Matt: It's quite startling. He does predict a lot of things that have a very clear coincidence with 
different subgroups and subcultures that we see today. 
So for instance, he says, one of the things that I'm concerned with is that people are going to 
give into a kind of passive nihilism where they're gonna assume there's really no point to my life. 
So the only thing that's worth pursuing is a kind of hedonic pleasure. And so they're gonna 
dedicate themselves to drugs and alcohol and opiates, to dull the pain, uh, of not having any 
kind of meaning to their life. And Nietzsche is very contemptuous of this, in a way that I think is 
deeply unfair.
Another kind of nihilism that he thinks is going to emerge – very interesting – is this strong 
commitment to scientific realism, because he says what you see when people describe 
themselves as realist is a re-articulation of the idea that knowledge has some kind of worth for 
its own sake, and the fact that I have a lot of knowledge and see the world the way that it is 
without judging it, without evaluating it, gives me a kind of purity.  
But the other more important predictions he makes is that there'll actually be very active kinds of 
nihilism or active responses to nihilism that will emerge.
Some of these more active forms of nihilism will be people who just enjoy destruction for its own 
sake. Wanna take revenge against the world on the basis of their feelings of profound 
resentment and alienation. 
Other groups he thinks will be unwilling to accept the full implication of the death of God. And 
what's gonna be interesting about them is he says they will try to produce utopias on earth. That 
essentially they'll say, We no longer have a kind of heaven that will guarantee us bliss in the 
future, but we are still committed to this Christian ethic of everyone achieving redemption and 
happiness, but we need to achieve it in the world here and now.
In one of his most remarkable formulations, he says, the truest forms of Christianity that are 
available right now are liberalism, utilitarianism, democracy, and especially socialism. ‘Cause all 
of these people are committed to this idea that we can carry on Christian morality, but we're just 
going to try to achieve a more happy, equal dignified society in this life now. And he thinks again 
that that's contemptuous, ‘cause it's not fully dealing with the implications of the death of God 
and… he wanted to smash it.

Human beings seem naturally inclined toward religion.

So.. what happens to our religious impulses… after the death of God?

That’s coming up… after a short break.

Sean: You know, I always read Nietzsche as saying there's gonna be a vacuum in the wake of 
this Enlightenment destruction of God. And something's gonna fill it. And what's gonna fill it is 
political religions, for lack of a better phrase, like nationalism, or communism or fascism, right? 
Like, that these -isms would become the new anchors of identity.
And human beings are deeply religious by nature, and that doesn't mean we're conventionally 
religious. I think what he meant was that human beings have a thirst for absolutes. We want to 
be certain, we want a horizon and a story that secures it for us. We want capital T truth, and  
whether it's God or political ideologies, we're gonna glom on to whatever provides us with this 
horizon of meaning.
Whatever gives us this way to interpret events and and validate action and all that kind of thing. 
That is partly why he was anticipating that there's gonna be a new kind of ideological 
metaphysical conflict in the 20th century, and it is a direct result of this destruction.
Matt: I think Nietzsche himself had complicated feelings about this, as he did about everything. 
At points in his writing, he does seem to be attracted to this kind of aesthetic idea of being a 
philosopher, right? Somebody who apprehends the world the way that it is, without illusions, 
without faith, without any kind of ulterior convictions being brought to bear on it.
But more often than not, I think you're absolutely right that he says, human beings actually 
cannot live like that, right? We cannot live according to this aesthetic outlook. We need to put 
our faith in something. And Nietzsche himself was one of the great secular mythmakers of all 
time. I mean his chief work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, is essentially a prophesizing of the 
appearance of the Superman or the Overman who's going to redeem the history of humankind 
because when he arrives, he's going to will great projects that will provide a sense of meaning 
and vindication to human life. 
So he set himself a task in some ways that no one could possibly achieve. He wanted 
simultaneously to be honest enough to reject any potential mythmaking that wasn't firmly 
grounded in reality, while at the same time being sufficiently honest to recognize that no human 
being including himself could possibly live with that.
A lot of the interesting dynamics of his texts come from the clash between these competing 
impulses I think.
Sean: You used the term Übermensch, right? The Superman. I think this is another term that 
people know, and they probably know it came from Nietzsche, but they may not know what he 
actually meant by that. What was the Übermensch for him?
Matt: I'm not sure he knew what the Übermensch was for him. Uh, at points he suggests, I am 
not an Übermensch and any Übermensch is gonna be necessarily stronger than me. So he is 
not gonna look like what I project onto him cuz he is gonna will his own identity into being. But at 
other points he has a kind of formula for the Übermensch.
And this is actually something that goes back to his early work on the birth of tragedy, where, 
one of the things that he points out is that with the elevation of the Christian egalitarian ethic, 
you see the diminution of heroic values of the sort that you saw in Homeric poems, where, if you 
think about somebody like Achilles, Achilles doesn't feel guilt over the massacres that he 
conducts. If anything, he sees his capacity to inflict violence as a testament to his strength, and 
as a sign that he's going to achieve immortality. 
And Nietzsche really admires this, to a certain extent, right, where he says, there is a vital, 
powerful, proud individual who doesn't allow the mass, who looks upon him as a frightening 
figure, to diminish his near divinity.
At the same time, Nietzsche also points out, uh, Achilles is kind of a dumb ass, is the only way 
to describe it. He has two modes of apprehension, either, you know, come at me, bro, or I'm the 
biggest and the strongest, and you're all gonna bow before me. And he does at points say that 
one of the things that Christianity accomplished was a deepening of the human soul through the 
inventions of things like guilt, through the invention of something like a conscience.
And even though this had the effect of undermining these, kind of, vital, heroic characteristics, 
he still wants to keep a little bit of that in his new Übermensch. One of the descriptions he gives 
of him is he would be a kind of Caesar with the soul of Christ, uh, which is a remarkably 
paradoxical formulation.
But I think you can kind of get the idea, right? It's somebody who's going to be thoughtful and 
reflective about the world in a way that somebody like Achilles just never is. But he's still going 
to embody these kinds of heroic, confident characteristics. And a lot of people have tried to 
pinpoint somebody who seems to match this configuration. Uh… but I don't think that anybody 
who had emerged in the 20th century who quite met it to his satisfaction, so they, not all the 
people like Hitler who claim to be a figure like this.
Sean: One of the most, I think, beautiful accounts of Christ actually is in Nietzsche's book, The 
Antichrist. He has this kind of begrudging respect for Christ. 
Matt: Oh yeah.
Sean: As this figure who established this kind of new moral universe, right? That is a supreme 
act of creation, and that is something he admires as much as anything.
Matt: Nietzsche often thought that having a great opponent who was worthy of you would of 
course compel you to become stronger, and it's very clear in The Antichrist, his best book on the 
subject. Christ was the one opponent he thought was worthy of him. Sometimes Socrates also 
gets thrown in there, but by, you know, his very late life, he was even signing his letters: The 
Antichrist.” About as megalomaniacal as you can possibly get, right? 
But I think that you're absolutely right that he sees Christ as doing something that is genuinely 
awe-inspiring, which is to create a world-historical faith that endures over the course of 2000 
years. And one of the reasons he says Christ was able to do that, of course, is because Jesus 
was willing to commit a supreme act of sacrifice in order to live according to his value system. 
He died on the cross for humanity, right? Compared to him, most other Christians are kind of a 
pale imitation, since how many Christians do you know who would actually be willing to lay 
down their life for another, the way that Jesus calls upon them to do.
Sean: He says that there was,but one Christian and he died on the cross.
Matt: Exactly. Right? I sometimes think it's a shame, uh, in a ulterior universe, Nietzsche 
actually reads Søren Kierkegaard, who he was planning on reading before he fell into madness, 
‘cause Kierkegaard himself had very similar views of Christianity near the end of his life. 
He would point out things like, listen, there's a fundamental difference between Christianity and 
Christendom – this kind of conservative nationalist outlook that reduces religion down to being 
essentially a social glue that allows people to live more easily. I think Nietzsche would've found 
a kind of kinship with this view.
Sean: I wanna go back to something you, you mentioned earlier, and that is really his, his 
hatred for democracy and his contempt for egalitarianism. 
Matt: Oh yeah.
Sean: In your essay, in that anthology on Nietzsche, you say that we, we really ought to 
understand him as – and now I'm quoting you – the most profound and dark defender of 
hierarchical reaction in the modern era.
What makes him both profound and dark from your point of view?
Matt: First off, I just wanna say that I think that Nietzsche is the greatest reactionary thinker of 
all time, maybe rivaled only by Dostoevsky, but what's interesting about Nietzsche is, and 
Losurdo points this out in his book, earlier kinds of conservatives were really committed to this 
idea that what we need in order to support a hierarchal worldview is more religion. Because 
religion serves as a kind of social conservative glue that also sublimates human hierarchies in 
important ways.
So you see people like Joseph de Maistre, for instance, characterizing the French Revolution as 
a fundamentally satanic enterprise. It's actually the term he uses in his Considerations on 
France. Nietzsche has no truck with that. Nietzsche says, actually, and this is what's so 
remarkable, the French revolutionaries were absolutely Christian in their orientation.
If anything, they took Christianity far more seriously because they really believe in human 
equality, human dignity, and human freedom for the herd, whereas these kind of crass social 
conservatives who think that you can use Christianity just aren't brave enough to interrogate 
their own worldviews sufficiently, uh, and Nietzsche is. 
And he says at the root of the French Revolution, socialism, liberalism, and democracy, is this 
Christian idea that all human souls are equal and that we should try to create a humane beatific 
world where the criteria of justice is how well is your society doing for the least among us.
And he says, I reject that emphatically. So we need to get rid of all these secular forms of 
Christianity, particularly socialism, but liberalism and democracy also need to go hard and we 
need to replace it with this system of aristocratic radicalism that is deeply committed to 
inequality at its very core.
Sean: Yeah, I mean, this is something you see really throughout Nietzsche's writing: this deep 
fear of the leveling power of mass culture. And he's always trying to protect the free creative 
individual against, to use his language, which you just used as well, the herd, and we shouldn't 
dance around this part of it, right? 
Matt: Oh no. 
Sean: He pretty clearly thinks that the average person cannot face up to reality, isn't up for the 
challenge of creating themselves, right, in the wake of God's death.
And the average person for that reason prefers to make a virtue of ignorance and self-
fulfillment, and that's all he sees when he looks at democracy, this triumph of the least creative.
Matt: Absolutely, right? Uh, he thinks that what you're going to see in a democratic society, let 
alone a liberal or socialist society, is a leveling, uh, of all higher values and a reduction of all 
human beings to the most animalistic level, where the kind of politics that people will be 
concerned about is how do we redistribute food to the poor more effectively?
How do we show greater compassion to human weakness and disability? You know, he would 
look at the kind of woke activists, uh, that people like Jordan Peterson hate so much and say 
these are the most Christian individuals in society right now. Way more Christian in many 
respects than the social conservatives who claim allegiance to this faith, ‘cause they really 
believe in catering and placating human weakness.
He doesn't want any of that. What he wants, again, is an aristocratic radical society where the 
lower orders can be used even as slaves, and he's not afraid of that term, for the projects of 
these truly great individuals. And the reason for this is he thinks that some people are just 
herds, right? Uh, animals.
They don't really contribute that much to life. They're gonna go about their merry little way, and 
if you give them too much power, they're going to drag the truly great amongst us down. So why 
let them? Why not reduce them to the level of slavery, and allow the great individuals out there, 
the Napoleons or whatever, to get on with the project of producing genuinely edifying 
enterprises in human life.
Sean: Look, human beings are not all the exact same– there are differences between 
individuals… anyone can observe that. It is the epitome of non-controversial. Some people are 
stronger, faster, smarter, better-looking… But… plenty of thinkers have made that same banal 
observation and still supported egalitarianism and liberal democracy. 
So, despite our differences, maybe all humans are equal on some deep metaphysical level. Or 
moral level, or whatever you prefer. Does Nietzsche actually give an argument for why he 
doesn’t think that’s true?
Matt: Well, I don't think that he actually provides a lot of arguments for this. Now, to be fair to 
him, he does point out that a lot of egalitarians just treat the equality of souls as an axiomatic 
truth, right? It's just something that's obvious and that we start our moral musings from. And I 
don't know that that is true.
I think that you need to develop a theory of equality that defends it comprehensively from a 
philosophical or theological perspective, and many of us don't bother to do that. Uh, and we 
should. 
On his front though, arguing that there is a fundamental inequality of the souls, I don't think he 
ever really provides compelling arguments for that, and I'm not sure that he's really confident 
about that. Precisely because he keeps flipping through the deck, if you wanna call it that, 
looking for the kind of right argument that will knock down, prove his point. 
So sometimes he'll say things like, look what I mean by an inequality of the souls... it's just the 
kind of Darwinian inequality that you see in nature, right? Where, yeah, the lambs look upon the 
eagles and they think that eagle is a really monstrous figure because it is strong and it is 
dangerous, And Nietzsche says, no, you know, the bird is just hungry. It probably doesn't even 
think about the lambs. It just looks upon them as a kind of tasty snack, and almost has a bit of 
love for them in that respect.
And I don't think that that's all that convincing, uh, not least of which, because from a purely 
Darwinian standpoint, cockroaches are the most evolved species, right? Because they'll fucking 
survive. And I don't think that Nietzsche’s saying, be more like the cockroach, right? That is the 
more evolved sensibility.
At other points, he tends to align it with a kind of health, psychological health, or even physical 
health. He says, look, just like there are healthier bodies and stronger bodies, so too are there 
healthier and stronger minds. He never really provides that much of a template for this, uh, but 
there's a kind of I know it when I see it mentality.
And… again, I'm just not really sure that I buy this idea that people who are psychologically 
more healthy are necessarily better than others? I'm not even sure how one would actually 
define that, especially because a lot of great people, including Nietzsche, seem psychologically 
very fucking unhealthy, let's put it that way, right? If anything, their deep deficiencies as 
individuals and their profound anxieties seems to be a catalyst for them engaging in these grand 
enterprises.
Again, is that self-evident? I don't think so. 
Sean: I agree.
Matt: But, it's a remarkably creative kind of interpretation. And I think that what's important 
about this is it does put pressure, theoretical pressure, on people like myself who are 
democratic socialists, to defend quality on a more theoretically sophisticated basis, rather than 
just treating it as axiomatically obvious that either people are equal, or that everybody is going 
to accept that people are equal.
music 

What would you say is the defining belief of political right? Is it a 
defense of tradition? A devotion to the past? 

Matt’s gonna tell us what he thinks… after one last quick break.

 

MIDROLL 2

Music


Sean: We tend to think of the political right as being mostly about this devotion to tradition or to 
gradual change, but you say, no, it's really much more about a defense of hierarchical 
organization. Why is that an important distinction for you to make, especially today?
Matt: Well, the political right has never actually been that committed to maintaining tradition. 
The way I define the political right is in terms of its commitments to inequality. I think that F.A. 
Hayek is absolutely right, that to be on the political right means that you believe there are 
demonstrably superior people in society and they're entitled to higher status, higher political 
influence, and more wealth if you're kind of crude. 
Ever since liberal and egalitarian movements have gained hegemony over much of the world, 
the effort has always been to try to push back against them, which is necessarily gonna entail 
transformative change of a certain type. 
And this is true of even people who will label themselves traditionalists of a certain sort. Think 
about somebody like Ronald Reagan in this country, right? Ronald Reagan instituted some of 
the most profound transformations in the United States since FDR.
Now, I think Reagan trains the country very much for the worse. And it's worth noting that, in the 
so-called land of the free that he constantly talked about, there were more people in jail in the 
USA by 1991 than there were in the Soviet Union, the so-called evil empire. 
Or even think about somebody like Margaret Thatcher, right? Margaret Thatcher presented 
herself as a conservative and enacted a revolutionary set of changes that were consciously 
intended to profoundly reformat British society. So even these traditionalist figures are not 
comfortable with retaining forms of egalitarian institutions that they don't want, and they're very 
happy to reconstruct them or even get rid of them if that's what's necessary, even if they've 
been around for decades.
You know a really telling example of this also is, uh, William Buckley. I'm sure you know 
Buckley, right?
Sean: Sure. The founder of the National Review, a very famous American conservative writer, 
thinker, pundit.
Matt: He used to go on campus tours and a bunch of know-it-all professors and eggheads like 
me would sometimes sit there and be like, you know, Buckley, like you're all about conserving 
and preserving and tradition and all that stuff. But what about like FDR's welfare state? Isn't that 
part of the American consensus? And shouldn't you be committed to conserving that? 
And every single time they said that, he laughed in their face, saying, I am not interested in 
conserving that at all. We have to get rid of it, and if that means big transformations, then so be 
it. Right? 
So the way that this aligns with Nietzsche is that he is very much in keeping with this attitude 
towards change that you see on the part of the political right, but he wants to go further than any 
of them are usually willing to go. For many on the political right, the ambition is to kind of turn 
back the clock on liberal secularism and move back to this more Christian model of hierarchical 
complementarity where there will be social stratification. It'll be justified according to a religious 
basis, uh, and… we'll all get along. 
Nietzsche says, actually the problem is that Christianity is at the base of all these egalitarian 
movements. Any kind of religion that emerges will probably also have the same propensities 
inherent within it.
So what we need to do is actually commit ourselves to a kind of militant secularism, because 
only once we become secularists that we can realize that Darwin is right, that there are 
fundamental inequalities between people, and that those should be reflected in society.
Sean: This is a really huge point. Most of the conservatives drawn to Nietzsche over the years 
don't really wanna face up to his challenge, right? They may hate progressivism and they want 
to reinforce Christianity as a moral and civilizational anchor. 
But Nietzsche's whole point is that it doesn't work like that, right? If you're a conservative who 
hates progressivism, you have to realize that the progressive movement for more egalitarianism 
grew out of Christian soil. It is a secular extension of Christian morality. Nietzsche is at least 
consistent in his contempt for that, but a lot of conservatives aren't. So they're trying to have 
their cake and eat it too.
Matt: Oh, absolutely. Right? I'll give two examples. Nietzsche would look at people like, say 
Jordan Peterson or Dinesh D’Souza, both claim to like Nietzsche and also wanted to defend 
Christian civilization. And he'd say, uh, you people may claim to believe in the Christian God, 
but you certainly don't like his message at all. You wanna reject his message as emphatically as 
you possibly can. 
By contrast, all those woke secularists that you constantly rail against might not even believe in 
the Christian God anymore, but boy oh boy, do they love his message. They absolutely agree 
as Frantz Fanon once put it, that the wretched of the earth have God on their side and will one 
day triumph, and should triumph, right?
So, think about Dinesh D’Souza's recent book, United States of Socialism. He is very 
contemptuous of people like Bernie Sanders for undermining a kind of religious conviction that 
he thinks is essential to holding the United States together.
But at the same time, he will directly appeal to Nietzsche to criticize things like the Scandinavian 
social democracies by saying even if a kind of social democracy could work, as it seems to 
there, why would we want to do that? That's a society he says, of last men, in the way that 
Nietzsche describes, where they are concerned for the least amongst them. They don't commit 
themselves to any kind of great projects. I want none of that. And this remarkable tension is 
never reconciled in his book. 
Jordan Peterson is even worse in a lot of senses, where, on the one hand, he will sit there and 
constantly appeal to Nietzsche, describing how this death of God has led to the birth of all kinds 
of secular totalitarian ideologies like communism or Marxism, while never taking on board 
Nietzsche’s fundamental point that communism isn't antithetical to Christianity; communism was 
Christianity. It's the herd gaining control of the house, and doing what they inevitably were going 
to do, which is level it.
Sean: It does feel like you… you sort of make a plea to the left. The left, certainly in this country, 
has a kind of reflexive discomfort with religion, certainly in the American tradition. But part of 
what you're saying here, and certainly part of what Nietzsche would say is that no, actually 
contemporary progressivism is very much an heir to the Christian tradition and that that 
presents a kind of political opportunity for the left that they probably haven't made good use of 
up to this point, but maybe they should. 
Matt: Yeah, I would absolutely agree with that. The most important Christian figure in American 
history is I think inarguably M.L.K, right? And M.L.K. was a radical in almost every respect. He 
wanted a very pronounced form of economic democracy, in addition to the elimination of all 
forms of racial hierarchization.
And he argued for that on a Christian basis, uh, I think correctly. And Nietzsche would've had 
nothing but contempt for someone like M.L.K., but at least he would've said, he really gets it. He 
understands what this message is about. It's about empowering the lower orders of society to 
strike back against the elites.
And I think that the left is mistaken if it assumes that there isn't a kind of power to this Christian 
ethic that it could mobilize on behalf of more progressive causes than it traditionally has been 
used for.
Sean: What do you make of Nietzsche’s appeal on what we now call the alt-right. I wrote a 
piece about this for Vox a few years ago after I heard that racist halfwit Richard Spencer tell 
someone in an interview that he was, quote, red-pilled by Nietzsche. But this faction of 
reactionary politics today, or right wing politics today, it's younger and more transgressive and 
it's kind of weird and, and clearly Nietzsche is a popular figure for them. 
And I think part of what I see happening here is Nietzsche is a very subversive writer and 
thinker. And in the last decade or so, the left has achieved a kind of cultural supremacy, right? 
The left is sort of influencing the culture more than the right has been.
And that has shifted some of that subversive transgressive energy to the alt-right, or whatever. 
And now there's this kind of punk rock delight in shit-posting anti-woke memes, and there's just 
something really juvenile about it. But I could see how Nietzsche could inspire it, right? He tells 
you, yeah, look, the society is all upside down.
All these sacred cows need to be slaughtered. If you're living in a multi-ethnic society, you trash 
pluralism, right? If you're part of a liberal democracy, then you play with fascism, right? It's just 
negation for the sake of negation or just poking holes in sacred cows for the sake of poking 
holes in sacred cows, and really nothing besides.
Matt: I mean, think of somebody like Paul Joseph Watson, who once said conservatism is the 
new counterculture.
Sean: Paul Watson, is that, is that the Alex Jones guy?
Matt: The very same.
Sean: Okay.
CLIP [Paul Joseph Watson, Feb. 2017]
PAUL: In fact, I’ve never seen so many members of the lefty twitterati as when I tweeted, 
“Conservatism is the new counterculture.” So I tweeted it again, and again, and again, 
and again.
Matt: You know, and I was pissed off at that because he says he likes things like Nirvana and 
punk. I'm like, you know, I don't know that defending the cops is all that punk buddy, but we'll 
put that aside for now.
I think that that's absolutely true. And I think this tells us something important about Nietzsche. 
Nietzsche's worry, really, was that even though God was dead and we should commit ourselves 
to this aristocratically radical vision of the world, that was not what was going to happen.
Uh, instead the herd would continue to triumph and various forms of secularized, Christian 
doctrines would become evermore hegemonic. And this would lead to a leveling of all higher 
values and the entrenchment of a very kind of nihilistic outlook over the world. 
And if you view these kinds of ideas as hegemonic, culturally, the way that you just described, 
you can understand why you could turn to Nietzsche as a kind of countercultural figure, and 
present yourself as a kind of right wing punk, or right wing countercultural figure. 
Now I think a lot of this is done in bad faith and it's extremely crude. Uh, and we can talk about 
how the right misappropriates Nietzsche, uh, but there is a kind of affinity there to his work that 
we shouldn't deny.
Sean: What do you think is the primary way in which the alt-right misappropriates or abuses or 
misreads Nietzsche?
Matt: Richard Evans in his Third Reich trilogy points out that Nietzsche had a profound 
influence on fascism. And this is something that has been better understood by historians than 
by philosophers. You know, we like Nietzsche and we wanna read him. And the idea that he 
was aligned with the most sinister movement of all time and profoundly influenced them is a 
deeply discomforting thought.
Sean: Yep.
Matt: But it is something that should give us pause because I think that Nietzsche was not a 
fascist thinker in some respects. But he definitely provides ammunition for far right movements, 
very overtly in many other respects. 
He wasn't a far right thinker in the sense that he was deeply contemptuous of nationalism, 
which was just another herd morality that was emerging by weak people, because they weren't 
able to will their own destiny as individuals. They needed to kind of project it onto this collective 
identity that would then be the standard bearer for great politics going forward. 
Uh, and some of the things that I admire about Nietzsche, is just how much fun he'll poke at 
things like antisemitism, German nationalism… So in these respects, we can criticize the far 
right for its appropriation of Nietzsche since it almost invariably turns in this kind of nationalist 
identitarian, racist direction. 
On the other hand, there is no denying that a person, again, who says we should train a group 
of slaves that will be at the service of the truly great people who will demonstrate their arrival 
through great politics of violence: that can be very conducive, to a kind of far right, alt right 
politics, and most of the people who've taken up his mantle, people like Richard Spencer, are 
inconsistent.
But they're not wrong to assume that Nietzsche provides a license for violence, exploitation, 
slavery, radical forms of inequality. Uh, and I think that we need to be attentive to that in a way 
that we haven't been in the past.
Sean: Well, that's sort of the other side of this. You know, if you're someone stewing in 
resentment and you're searching for a psychologically satisfying explanation for your own 
discontent, this punk rock side of Nietzsche is pretty intoxicating. You read 'em and you're 
thinking to yourself, well, the problem isn't me. Right? It's, it's this unthinking herd out there, 
right? 
The world is rejecting me because I refuse to dance to the same conformist music as everyone 
as everyone else, right? When of course, the reality almost invariably is that the person thinking 
that is not the Übermensch he thinks he is. And yes, it's usually men. 
But if you're the type who doesn't like what the world's become or becoming, it is not hard to see 
the appeal of Nietzsche's obsession with decline and decadence. And, like, the Ayn Rand 
fanatics who, who read her work and think they're John Galt. Right? And society is stifling their 
greatness.
You're not, I'm sorry to say, actually,
Matt: Whenever somebody puts down on pen and paper that we should have an aristocratic 
and highly elitist society, it's a pretty good bet that they think they're gonna be part of that elite, 
right?
Sean: Of course!
Matt: And, the problem with texts like this is of course, it invites readers who are sympathetic to 
the text to imagine that they will also be part of that elite.
Like, you very rarely will find Ayn Rand fanatics who will sit there and say, I'm not John Galt. I'm 
one of the second-handers. Same is true. You very rarely find people who read Nietzsche's 
politics, sympathetically imagining while I am part of that herd and I will be the slave. And that's 
all well and good, right?
But I think this is where I would offer my own critiques of Nietzsche. And I think we need to be 
critical of him as a philosopher, in a way that maybe we haven't before. One of the things that's 
interesting about Nietzsche is he's a profound diagnostician of ressentiment, or resentment, but 
he only ever locates resentment on the political left, where it's envious people looking up and 
wanting to bring others down. 
He very rarely talks about the kind of resentment that can emerge on the political right. Uh, 
which I think is by far the most potent kind of resentment that you find in politics today.
And the resentment that you see emerging on the political right very much is this kind of 
aristocratic attitude, that, I am entitled to superior status relative to others. And this is being 
taken away from me by the losers of society. I can't quite understand how, but they keep 
managing to accomplish that. And I am embittered about that and I will do something about it. 
Sometimes this can take extraordinarily malicious forms. Probably the worst example of this 
kind of right wing ressentiment that I found is George Wallace in the 1960s, uh, who was the 
governor of Alabama. He once said that if the Supreme Court will actually enforce 
desegregation in schools, then I'll just get rid of all public schools in Alabama. My white children 
will not go to school with Black children. And if that's the kind of equality that we're going to see, 
then no one will go to school.
And this is just something that Nietzsche never really contemplates. This idea of aristocratic 
resentment. And I think we need to be much, much more pronounced in diagnosing that in our 
society right now. 
The real creatures of spite and malice that exist right now usually aren't people on the political 
left. There are plenty of them in the Trumpist movement who think that this is their country. They 
were entitled to it. They're better than others, and they will not allow the losers and immigrants 
of the world to take it from them.
Sean: I mean, you're a teacher, I assume you, you teach Nietzsche. And, and I'm not asking 
you, you, like, you, how do you counsel your students not to read Nietzsche? I mean, I think you 
and I both pretty firmly believe he is absolutely worth reading. Whatever you think of him.
Matt: Oh yeah, everyone should read him. 
Sean: He's indispensable to trying to make sense of the pathologies of, of modern politics and 
much, much more.
But when you do encounter someone who's younger, like we once were, but when you do 
encounter someone who's being entranced by Nietzsche in some of these ways we've 
described, what do you say to them? How do you tell them to read Nietzsche or to take 
Nietzsche – or do you at all?
Matt: I do. Yeah. I mean, look, I teach a class on the political right? And Nietzsche is an 
important module on that. And I think that Nietzsche can have a profoundly beneficial effect on 
students by getting them to ask questions that they didn't before, by instilling in them a deep 
sense of intellectual honesty, and really just by fostering their creativity, right?
I mean, that's something we didn't talk about, but Nietzsche has been a profound influence on 
all kinds of artists through the 20th and 21st century, most of whom I really admire. People like 
James Joyce, for example. So if anything, we should be encouraging people to read more of 
Nietzsche.
But we need to also insist that they read him carefully, and recognize that there is a deep 
politics in his work. It is a politics that is fundamentally contrary to the liberal and egalitarian 
values on which your society is predicated. And I think that there's a lot of, I'll just use the term 
evil, in what it is that he's trying to accomplish politically. And we should be critical of that, while 
also accepting the fact that there are extraordinary gems in that work, as well.
Sean: What I've always said about Nietzsche is that, and I used to teach him as well, he can 
only take you so far. And if you're concerned with politics, he will lead you into an abyss 
because he can't offer, doesn't wanna offer, any basis for meaningful collective action.  
His thought necessarily collapses into a muddled individualism, which is why he, I think, 
ultimately becomes much more useful to artists than to politicians and legislators. But he 
remains incredibly important and incredibly dangerous because he was right about quite a bit, 
and we are still very much living in the shadow of his destruction.
Matt: I mean, along with Marx, he's, um, one of the great diagnosticians of the crisis of 
modernity that emerged in the 19th century. And he's indispensable to understanding that.
The way that I go about rebutting him is by saying, look, I take seriously this idea that 
ressentiment can lie at the basis of all human actions.
Uh, and I don't think that there's any denying that there's plenty of ressentiment on the left as 
well. Anyone who sits there and sees those “burn the rich” or “eat the rich” signs can't help but 
be a little bit worried about that. But I think that progressive causes, unlike what he thinks, 
actually require quite a bit of strength, creativity, and will to go into them if they're going to be 
successful. 
And I think he profoundly underestimated the emotional importance of love as a kind of 
empowerment, including universal love. Whether you understand that in a Christian, a liberal or 
a socialist way, that's the kind of emotional basis on which I'd want to ground my politics, not 
this kind of aristocratically radical sensibility.
Sean: I think that's a, that's a good note on which to end. 
This was awesome, man. I love this stuff, so I appreciate you coming in to help me think it all 
through, Matt.
Matt: Yeah. Thanks. I had a great time.

I think it’s really easy to write Nietzsche off. But he, as much as anyone – maybe better 
than anyone – was willing to stare down some of our darkest instincts, some of our 
worst impulses… and really reckon with them. And to go on that journey with Nietzsche 
– looking into the abyss, as he would put it – is kind of a thrill, as a reader. And 
whatever one thinks of Nietzsche, I think he’s always going to be worth reading.
