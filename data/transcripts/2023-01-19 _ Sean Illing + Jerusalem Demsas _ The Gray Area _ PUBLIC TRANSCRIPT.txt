INTRO:
Sean Illing: Think about where you live. Why do you live there? And since 2020....do you find 
yourself wanting... a different home, somewhere else?

Since that landmark year, the American home buying and rental markets have gone from hitting 
record lows…. to exceeding record highs. 

And pandemic-era economic changes are the driver. Many of us are now working from home, 
and have re-thought where we can and want to live…. Which means people are moving. In fact, 
there are fewer homes available for sale than ever -- there just isn't enough supply for all the 
demand. 

And that has all kinds of ripple effects – especially on those who are unhoused or on the verge 
of losing their homes. 

In this country, there isn't a safety net if you're on the edge. So, the number of people 
experiencing homelessness is on the rise. 

Why can't we keep up with the supply of houses....and what do we owe our fellow human 
beings when it comes to shelter?

ID: I’m Sean Illing, and this is The Gray Area.

My guest today is Jerusalem Demsas. She’s a staff writer at The Atlantic and she used to be a 
policy reporter here at Vox…you might even recognize her as the former co-host of The Weeds.

Demsas is a housing policy expert….she can explain the market – past and present – better 
than anybody I know. But, as you'll hear, she's also keenly aware that human beings are at the 
heart of housing...and that where we live, or can't live… has a dramatic effect on our lives.

So I invited Jerusalem on the show to talk about all this… and the first thing I wanted to know 
was… how did she get drawn in the first place to write about… housing in the first place?

music


Jerusalem Demsas: It's really funny cuz like you can obviously come up with a bunch of stories 
for why you are where you are. But in this particular case, it actually is quite a direct story. Like I 
was in, I was studying economics in undergrad and I was in a labor market economics class and 
there was like an extra assigned reading for something and it was a paper by a Yale law 
professor called David Schleicher.
And it was a paper called "Stuck". And this was in 2017 and so it was right after Donald Trump 
had just won the presidential election, and was about to be sworn in, I believe. And so everyone 
was like, there were all these theories floating about, around, what's going on in real America, 
like what has happened to upend conventional political thinking around who was going to win 
this election. 
Basically the premise of the paper was that for a long period of time, moving from an 
economically depressed region to one that was growing would always pay off from an economic 
standpoint because even though the cost of living was higher, the wages you were earning were 
so much higher than what you would've been earning, that it made sense to move.
So if you're a janitor in New York City, you're making a lot more and your standard of living is a 
lot higher than if you are a low wage worker in a rural town. That doesn't have the same kind of 
economic opportunities. But over the course of the late 20th century, as we're seeing a lot of 
things in particular, as we're seeing the cost of housing grow, this script begins to flip that like, 
yes, you see a lot higher wages, but for more and more people, the cost of living grows to the 
point that you don't actually see this pencil out. 
And so what that means is that a lot of people end up being stuck in these communities where 
there aren't really good jobs, but the good jobs are in a place where the cost of living is too high 
for them to access it. And, you know, I was like, you know, a senior in college and I was like, 
wow. Like I have figured out exactly why, all of these people voted for Donald Trump. And I had 
this like a monocausal explanation for a couple of months. But the more I got into housing, the 
more I realized that there's just really under. Or, or misunderstood and also, um, largely ignored 
phenomenon of, of what's going on in our housing market.
And it's really, really important and it plays a really big role in how people's lives turn out. 
Sean Illing: Is there a simple way for you to sum up what's actually broken about housing policy 
in this country other than the fact that the rent's too damn high?
Jerusalem: The fundamental problem is that housing policy is not oriented around making sure 
that there is affordable, accessible housing for everyone. And there's a bunch of things that 
stream out. 
Because we are not focused on that, we're focused on a bunch of things, whether it's preserving 
the way communities look right now, or increasing property values in some areas, or whatever it 
is, because our focus is not affordable accessible housing, you have a bunch of different 
policies that spring from that, that end up making it impossible for people to live where they 
need to live. And I think it can sound really wonky when we're talking about things like zoning 
regulations or housing finance, or how to finance affordable housing or whatever it is.
But at the fundamental level, it's just like, people should be free to live where they want to live 
because that's like the foundation for a good life. Picking your own community or being able to 
stay in a community that you're rooted in. It is the foundation for your spiritual life or your, like, 
personal life or the people you end up wanting to be friends with or marry or whatever it is.
And if you're not able to make the choice about where you live under a housing market that is 
basically excluding you because of prices, because of rents, because of fundamentally 
insufficient supply and insufficient diversity of types of housing, then you can't make that choice.
You're being pushed to live where you can afford to live, and that means your community is 
being chosen for you. It means your life is being chosen for you in a way that you have very little 
control over.
Sean: So, I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, but we're not afraid to ask the stupid questions 
around here, so I'm gonna ask it anyway. 
Do we even have a clear definition of what - to use, the phrase, I think you used – what 
affordable, accessible housing actually means?
Jerusalem: Yeah,it's a big question because I mean, it depends, it's like affordable for who, like 
what do we mean by this? And, the federal government has this idea of what's affordable to 
someone with a certain percentage of the area median income.
So like someone with 50% of the area median income. So who's doing worse than a lot of 
people in their community, what's affordable to them is obviously very different than the 75th 
percentile or 150% or whatever it is.  

But then also there's this question of like, how much of this is bringing down the cost and how 
much of this is a problem of poverty. Like, often people are talking about affordable housing, 
they're talking about it from a middle class standpoint. Like, they're talking about how can I 
afford a first starter home that's 300 or $400,000? Um, and for a lot of people who are working 
in the housing space, when they're talking about affordable housing, they're really focused on 
low income renters, people who could maybe afford, you know, 300, $400 a month to pay on 
rent.
And so, I agree that this is like a very nebulous term, but I also think it's just like this, the 
animating idea that like regular people should be able to afford housing and shelter is like not 
really what's at the center of what we're doing today,
Sean: I know you've argued that a, a big part of the problem is this, you know, mythos of home 
ownership in this country and we'll, we'll get to that, uh, a little bit later. I just have to say that I, I 
kind of hate you for making this argument because I'm a homeowner and I know you're correct, 
but I'm already decked deep in this sinkhole of money and I can't back out now, so I'm just 
gonna lean into my cognitive dissonance, I guess.
Jerusalem: I think in general with these conversations, because as I've mentioned, housing is 
so personal to people. I wanna make sure, like I am often just trying to talk about housing policy 
at a macro level. I think the individual decisions people are making for their lives or like == 
you're, we're all constrained by what's available to us. And also there's a lot of good reasons to 
be a homeowner. 
So no shame. No shame.
Sean: Just don't buy a house with foundation issues. I'm gonna drop that nugget. I'm gonna 
moonwalk right outta the virtual room. 
I wanna ask you how much of the homelessness problem in this country – and that's something 
I really wanted to to to dive into in this conversation – how much of that problem is the direct 
result of our housing policies? In other words, how much of the homelessness problem has 
been effectively engineered in this country?
Jerusalem: Yeah, this is a really good question, and I think it requires taking a step back to 
think about what we mean by causality. Like what causes what. Because if you talk to someone 
you know on the street or someone who's at a shelter or someone who is couch surfing, and 
you say like, Hey, like how did you end up in the situation? 
They're gonna tell you a story about individual vulnerability that is completely true. They're 
gonna tell you about maybe a divorce that they went through that cut their income in half. 
They're gonna talk about a medical emergency that they went through that really impacted their 
finances, a lost job, a predatory landlord that evicted them and left them with a black mark on 
their record that made it difficult for them to rent again.
And all of these things are true, for that person. Like that's what happened. 
But when we think about macro changes across time, you have to look for what's changing, at 
the societal level because there have always been predatory landlords. There's always been 
poverty, there's been lots of divorce. There's been all these different things. 
But the rate at which we're seeing folks become homeless, now it's around 500,000 people in 
this country are homeless. And more importantly, there are tens of millions of low income 
renters who are always at that brink of potentially becoming homeless if they face one of these 
emergencies. That is new.
And the cause of that is when you look across the country, there are states that are high poverty 
that don't see the kinds of homelessness that places like California and Washington and 
Massachusetts see. When you look at places that have high rates of mental illness and high 
rates of drug addiction, they don't see the level of homelessness.
What you do see across the country is that what determines whether a state sees or an area 
sees high rates of homelessness is whether it a sufficient amount of housing available to very 
low income renters. And whether the very bottom of the market, there are renting opportunities 
available for people who are in dire financial situations.
And if those exist, like in places like Detroit or in Philadelphia where there's a lot of housing 
relative to what we see in places like San Francisco or LA or Boston or DC, you don't see that 
rates of homelessness, even if there's poverty, even if there's mental health issues, even if 
there's drug addiction – because the housing is available.
And it sounds really simplistic, but like the problem of homelessness is in the name. It's homes. 
People don't have them. And I think it's really reasonable why people don't conceptualize it this 
way. If you come across homelessness in your daily life, you're likely to experience it or 
remember it in a way that's pretty jarring. Like maybe you see someone experiencing a mental 
health crisis, or you see like drug addiction going on, or you see something that seems 
extremely jarring to you in public. And that becomes your vision for how homelessness functions 
in society. 
But most homelessness is like not seen that way, right? You don't notice someone who's 
crashing at a motel. You don't notice someone who's couch surfing in their friend's apartment, 
kids being separated to different family homes because there's no central place where they can 
all live together. Those things are really hidden and that's what makes up the bulk of 
homelessness.
Sean: You know, and I appreciate that you go there with this, you know, because it's like, you 
know, you can ask like, so, you know, what's the, what's the link between housing, affordability 
and homelessness? 
 And, of course, some might roll their eyes and go, well, if houses are too expensive or if we 
don't have enough, then there will be lots of people experiencing homelessness.
But it is more complicated than that. And part of the problem is that a lot of us probably have 
preconceived notions about what it means to lose your home and what that looks like. So we’re 
missing a lot of what’s going on here. 
Jerusalem: Yeah, and I think it’s sort of like a funnel, right? Like you have at the very top, a 
large number of people who are in unstable housing situations who are low income, for whom a 
specific emergency might push them into homelessness. 
And then of those people, like a certain number, if there's not enough housing, will fall into 
homelessness. And then for many of those people, it'll become much more worse, whether 
because of individual vulnerability, like the ones we talked about. Or because of just bad luck. I 
mean, luck is also a big factor in this. When you talk to people who are homeless, you're just 
like, wow. Like that's just like insanely unlucky, that that would happen to you on top of all these 
things.
And for those people, when these populations are large enough, then you get a larger growing 
number of people who are chronically homeless, who are experiencing extremely difficult things 
on the street, and then become exposed to potentially really harmful drug situations or criminal 
activity and become victimized themselves and enter that kind of cycle of poverty and violence.
And that's a situation where, I think it's really important to realize that people see this and they're 
saying like, okay, like I just don't get why the government can't get these people off the street. 
It's only 500,000 people, and that's actually a quite manageable sum for the entirety of the 
United States, right? Like, that's not actually that many people. When you think about all the 
government services that are available.
The problem is, of course, we have to address the flow of people who are falling down that 
funnel. You have to stabilize those people so we can actually help the chronically homeless, the 
folks who are in shelters, to get outta that situation.
Sean: Okay, so if we have a supply problem, then that means we have a building stuff problem. 
Which leads to the question, why is it so damn hard to build things, to build houses, more 
houses in this country? Why is it so much more expensive here than it is in other places?
Jerusalem: Yes. So the fundamental reason, and in particularly in these really high cost of 
living cities and counties and suburbs, where the house, the homelessness crisis is most acute, 
is because it is illegal to build housing. 
And I wanna be clear here, what I mean is that in these places, you own a single family home 
that is on a lot where the city has said it must be minimum 10,000 square feet. And you are not 
allowed to tear that home down and build a house that is 9,000 square feet.
You own this home and it is illegal for you to do this. And that is compounded by regulation after 
regulation. It's illegal for you to build a duplex on that lot. It is illegal for you to build a mother-in-
law suite in your backyard on that lot. And what that does is that it compresses the number of 
housing opportunities that are available to people.
And it also inflates the size artificially of the houses that are allowed to be built, which means 
that houses more and more are built to, over the course of the 20th century, we see houses 
being getting larger and larger. It used to be that you could find tons of starter homes, 1500 
square feet, that would be like a first house that someone would buy, maybe when they're in 
their late twenties, early thirties.
The supply of those starter homes is like dwindling to near non-existence, especially in these 
areas. 
What that means is that it becomes, you're raising the floor for what it means to buy a house. 
Sean: Is part of the story there cultural, like has home ownership became more and more of a 
status symbol, I guess in some sense? That the drive to create bigger and bigger and bigger 
houses and have more space between houses, that this is all sort of like compounding and 
contributing to the problem.
Jerusalem: I think it's hard to tease out the story of zoning regulations is, alot of it has to do 
with wanting to keep areas segregated by race and by class in particular. And even when that 
gets struck down, there is a desire to maintain a certain type of community, which includes kind 
of racialized and classist ideas. But also is just like, those ideas inform then what we think of as 
a nice neighborhood. This idea of like a white picket fence, every house kind of looks the same. 
That's also informed by how our transportation policy was created as well. 
And obviously there would be big houses in America regardless of this. It's a very wealthy 
country we live in and there are a lot of people who could afford to have bigger houses. 
But there are a lot of people who can't, who used to be able to buy their way in or rent their way 
to greater degrees of prosperity. And that being eliminated, I think has a lot less to do with 
culture and a lot more to do with the literal policies,and both unintended and intended effects of 
making it illegal to build even small single family homes.

It’s not just money…homeowners employ a ton of tactics to maintain their 
property values. 

Coming up after the break, Jerusalem and I discuss the sneaky but 
consequential world of environmental protections….

 

MIDROLL 1

music 

Sean: Correct me if I'm wrong on anything here, but you know, other countries allow the state to 
regulate and enforce environmental standards or building codes or that sort of thing. 
But here, the whole process – I'm not sure if it's right to say that it runs through the legal system 
– but the process is vulnerable to the legal system in ways that just continually undercut efforts 
to build things.
Jerusalem: Yeah, so, in the US, one example of this is there's a law called the National 
Environmental Policy Act. And it mostly applies to like big transit projects or just large, very, very 
large projects that might be done, energy projects or things like that. And then at the state and 
local level, there are environmental regulations that are modeled off of this. 
What ends up happening is that you create this framework for which developers or individual 
property owners have to justify to the state, that the thing that they're trying to build does not 
violate some sort of environmental desire. 
And that sounds good in practice, right? Like you think like, oh yeah, it makes sense. Like when 
someone's building something, we don't want it to harm the environment. 
But what's actually happening is that, things that are obviously not going to be harming the 
environment like a bike lane, like a solar project, like are being stopped in protection of things 
like parking lots, or, you know, single family homes, which we know increase car dependency 
and make it more difficult to transition to a more clean energy future. 
And so what ends up happening is that on project by project level, you are creating these 
regulations that are really, really onerous. We know that multifamily housing is more 
environmentally friendly. One, because heating costs and cooling costs are shared amongst a 
bunch of different people. Like I live in an apartment building, even if I turn my heat off, it doesn't 
get that cold in here because my neighbors have their heat on. The building itself is heated in 
the hallways and things like that. That shared environmental benefit is obviously baked in. 
But in other countries, right, we trust the government to say, the government itself will have the 
ability to make the determination about whether or not something is environmentally friendly or 
not. And instead in our country, what we do is we create this avenue for people to sue. And so 
you can sue and say, Hey, I don't think that this environmental impact statement or this report 
was filled out properly. And then you just, instead of actually pursuing the end of environmental 
protection, what you've done is create a space for people who have access to lawyers, very 
wealthy people, interest groups.
Sean: Right. 
Jerusalem: And it's one of those things where it's like very clear that these laws are being used 
and a ton of regulations, which sound really good in theory, are actually being used for bad 
ends.
Sean: Well, I mean this intersects with an argument you've made – I think correctly – about the 
contradictions of liberal ideology. You know, liberals want housing to be affordable, especially 
for groups that have been excluded in the past. 
But that bumps up against the material interest of incumbent homeowners who use the system 
of laws and regulations we've created in the name of transparency and fairness –but they use 
them to protect their own wealth. 
And I think that's just a fact of the matter – and I think it's important to just call it out. And you do.
Jerusalem: Yeah, I definitely think this is one of the things that's most important to recognize is 
that people really are good in recent decades at identifying regulatory capture, right?
But what we've become not very good at seeing is the way in which we ourselves or people who 
are regular voters can also capture parts of government and make it difficult to do things that 
are broadly popular or broadly necessary for the rest of us.
So, for instance, you know, homeowners, there's nothing wrong with being a homeowner. Of 
course not. But we've created a system in which we've pitted certain people's interests against 
everyone's interests. And what that means is, like, some groups of homeowners may not want 
people living there who are very, very wealthy, may not want poor people in their community.
I wrote a story last year about how this very, um, expensive exclusive town in Atherton, 
California. This guy named Mark Andreessen, he is a venture capitalist, he's a billionaire.. He 
has written a lot about how government is captured by incumbent interests, how we need to 
build big things. He and his wife submitted a public comment in his town of Atherton opposing 
the building of multifamily housing, saying that it would destroy property values, and raising a 
significant other concerns.
And it's just that, it's a situation where, we have created a system where like someone like that 
can recognize, of course, on a societal level how harmful it is to stimi the government in this 
kind of opposition. And how much it makes it difficult to build things that are necessary, whether 
it's housing or infrastructure projects or renewable energy or whatever it is.
But at the same time, on an individual level, feels empowered to stop that in their own 
community. And if there are people in every community who wanna stop that, they're not gonna 
feel individually responsible for the collective effect. But that system is making them individually 
responsible. 
And within liberalism, I think that you just mentioned, I think there are these competing impulses 
of like, feeling a sense of urgency around climate change, feeling a sense of urgency around 
racial justice and class justice and economic justice.
And at the same time, feeling a sense that there should be community control, which prevents 
the government and prevents the private market from building things. And it's a balance. There's 
a level at which you want both of those things to exist, but we've shifted so far in the direction of 
community control at this point where, if there's a scarcity of something, rich people are gonna 
get it, you know,
And so, it's people who are in the middle class, it's people who are poor, who are gonna be 
really screwed in that situation.
Sean: yep.
Jerusalem: Yeah.
Sean: Yeah. Fancy that, huh?
So you just mentioned an example from California and, you know, California is what everyone 
likes to point to as the case study of what's wrong or broken in this space. Do you think that's 
why, I mean, does California for lots of reasons, exemplify or distill all of these problems?
Jerusalem: I mean, I think with California, they're just a little bit ahead of the curve of what 
what's coming down the pipe for a lot of places. 
So the places that are experiencing the worst of the housing crisis are the places that have seen 
the most economic growth. And that means a ton of people have tried to move there to share in 
that economic growth, to add to that economic growth, to take part in the dynamism that exists 
in these places.
And California has not one, but two major centers of that, both Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
And it benefited from that for a long time. It benefited from that. That is the one of the growing 
parts of the entirety of the US economy, let alone the California economy, is this pull to have 
really great workers come in and economists refer its idea as agglomeration economies, when 
workers come together, when workers come together and firms come together and discover that 
they're more productive together than they are further apart. That's why you get a Silicon Valley. 
That's why you get like a Hollywood, people come together and they learn from each other. 
They spin off and create new things that are related to those fields. 
But on top of that, it's not just those people, right? When those people all move there, they 
demand a bunch of services and goods. They demand lawyers and legal services. They 
demand doctors and nurses and hospitals. They demand taxi drivers, new restaurants, all these 
different things. So you create a bunch of different jobs that aren't just directly related to that 
field. And while California enjoyed that growth, it didn't wanna accommodate for that growth by 
building sufficient housing.
Now, other places are also growing, right? Like it's not just the California cities. And the other 
superstar cities with similar phenomenons like Seattle or Boston or DC or whatever it is. You 
now see cities growing like Austin, Texas, like Phoenix, Arizona, like Miami, like, Raleigh – all 
these different cities, Nashville. Like you see these cities also experiencing increasing amounts 
of growth, both because they have things that they're pulling industries to. 
But also because California, Seattle, all these other places haven't accommodated for workers, 
and workers are forced to move. And of course in the last couple of years, the new 
phenomenon of remote work has allowed for more and more people to forgo living in these 
places and still benefit from those jobs. 
And so you see a lot of growth happening. And you see a lot of the patterns being repeated, 
right? Like you see in Florida, Florida State government, which is a place that has, you know, 
traditionally really been telling people – Move here. We want that growth. We're excited for it –  
trying to block local efforts to build more housing. 
So it's not a thing that I think is specific to California. I think that California was just, and the west 
coast in general were just, ahead of the curve in the economic experience.
Sean: So is the, you know, the Nimbyism problem you were just talking about with Mark 
Andreessen, you know, that's 'not in my backyard' for those unfamiliar with the term – is that 
phenomenon unusually bad in California? Or are we just more aware of it in California?
Jerusalem: Two things here. 
One is that not in my backyard usually refers to someone who is in favor of something in 
general. Like, you're in favor of affordable housing in general. But you're not in favor of it in your 
backyard or like your neighborhood or something like that. 
So I think that that's really evident amongst liberals, because I think we, like, often do talk a lot 
about wanting more affordable housing or wanting more clean energy. 
But the idea of just in general, this idea of opposition towards new things, towards change, 
towards growth, I think it's just like a human thing. I think we're all kind of like NIMBYs in that 
way, right? If you buy a house in a community, you kind of like the way that it is. You could 
imagine certain things changing for the better. Like maybe you want more trees or you want, 
like, the curb to be repainted or whatever it is. So you have things that you can imagine 
improving it, but like they're small things usually, or like obvious improvements that are not really 
structural, big changes that are different than what you would've imagined when you first bought 
the house.
And so I think that that's a pretty human element. And what you want in a society is a 
government which can mediate between desires for stability, and also accommodate and 
encourage healthy growth and change. Because I think that when people become too attached 
to a community as a series of buildings or infrastructure, they can forget the thing that makes 
their community great are the people, right?
I think about this a lot, in like, I grew up right outside DC and you know, you can just trace the 
growth of where new immigrant food pops up based on the commercial rents in an area. And it 
used to be that, like, there were lots of cool, new, amazing restaurants popping up all around 
the inner core of DC all the time.
And now, I mean, for the last decade at least, all of them have been in the suburbs and further 
and further out from the core. And so are you missing out on cool new, amazing things that new 
people can bring you? Because places only really change and experiment when they're 
available to people for whom changing and experimenting is what you wanna do.
So you're young, you don't have a lot of money, you need to rent somewhere cheap. You can't 
have that, then you're not going to have that kind of dynamism.
Sean: Yeah. And look, I don't wanna paint every person who opposes developments, you know, 
in their neighborhood as cartoon villains. I mean, I get that people move to certain places, to 
certain neighborhoods because they like the aesthetics of that place. Or they like the community 
in that place. And these things are fragile and they can change or go away and make the place 
different or unrecognizable. And that is a not trivial concern. I do just wanna say that. 
How much of this do you think is just a scarcity problem, right? This is a country without social 
safety nets, where everyone is kind of on their own, where the only way to secure your future 
and your family's future is to just acquire as much wealth and resources as possible.
And it's not hard to see how that imperative collides with the housing crisis. You know, people, 
they're defending their property values. And in a country where homes are such a huge financial 
asset, I get it.
Jerusalem: Yeah, I think a few things here. 
One is that it's not actually clear to me that people are actually working in service of their 
property values here. Let's take that example of like, you own your own property and a 
developer comes to you, Sean, and says the city has just upzoned and they now are allowing 
me to build a duplex on your lot. And now your lot is worth a lot more to me than it was before 
when it was just a single family home. 
And I say, Sean, I'll pay you $200,000 more – me the developer – than what you paid for it, to 
buy your house and turn that into a duplex.
Your property values have gone up because it's become more possible to build more housing. 
So, it's not really clear to me that people are actually acting always in their financial interest 
when they do this. We've created this idea in America in general that like apartments are 
blights, that people who live in them are poor, they're immigrants, it's dirty, those are slums.
This is something that's been developed and pushed both by, like, the court system and also 
politicians and cultural rhetoric. Which is not something that was inherently going to be that way. 
It was definitely something that was created intentionally. 
But, that first point I think is really important that, like, I don't think people are often acting in their 
best financial interests. Especially when you factor in, when you grow older, there's now tons of 
people. Like AARP is now an organization that's been working a lot on housing supply because 
they have a phenomenon of seniors who buy houses, they are trapped in them, because they're 
like, you know, the house is an asset that has like money stored in it, but they don't wanna 
move.
But they also can't access a second floor of their house anymore because they can't go 
upstairs. And so they're stuck on the bottom floor of their home. So they're confined to the first 
floor of their homes, and they would move to a smaller unit in their community, but that doesn't 
exist, because they've been opposing the building and construction of affordable housing, or of 
different types of housing in their areas.
And so you're screwing over your future self, often as a homeowner, when you oppose these 
things. You're screwing over your kids, maybe, who won't be able to stay and grow up and live 
in your community. That means you can't live near your grandkids.
So I think that there's this idea that these people are always acting in their best interests and 
often they actually are not. So I think the important thing is here, how do you construct a 
government system which takes the reasonable concerns around massive amounts of change 
and weighs those against the costs of not building?
Because if I turn to you and I said like – Hey, you can vote for this policy and you'll get to keep 
your neighborhood exactly how you like it, but it's gonna cost every worker in America $10,000 
a year. We would think that's ridiculous. But that's actually what's going on here, is that the 
costs are so great that wages have been impacted at that kind of a level.
And so, I, I really do think that it's a question, not of how do we change people's minds around 
this, but how do we create a government system which mediates all of these concerns in a 
reasonable way?
Sean: An argument I often hear, mostly from conservatives, is that progressive cities like San 
Francisco or LA or New York City have bigger homeless populations because they provide all 
these welfare services, which in the end just enable the very problems they purport to solve. 
Now we have some data on this, right? And it disproves this claim, no?
Jerusalem: So, I mean, the first thing I'll say is I, I like to put people in kind of in the mindset of 
what would happen to them and try to, like, logic this out a bit, right? 
Let's say that Sean, for some reason you had a massive financial emergency. You and your 
family are about to be homeless. The first thing that you probably do is you tap your family and 
friend connections. Like, hi, like, can you help me out for a little bit? Like, I just need to get back 
on my feet. People can't help you out. You like, make sure your kids are okay. You make sure 
your spouse is okay. You try to find a place to have just immediate shelter. 
The idea that someone would leave their community to go to a place that they have never been 
to where they have no connections to job networks, no connections to social supports, because 
they heard that San Francisco or Los Angeles is like a better place to be homeless doesn't 
actually make any sense, like, it's just not how individual people react to crises. They stay in 
their places they're familiar with because they know that they can get access to services or help 
from the networks that they already have in those places. 
So we know that people like, you know, maybe would move from like a Montgomery County, 
Maryland to a DC, or they'd move from like a Long Island to a Manhattan or something like that.
But people are not making multi-state trips to get to blue cities to get access to services, which 
often are not actually that great, especially on the West Coast, which we know never has 
enough beds anymore to accommodate the homeless population. 
The second thing is though, when you look at randomized control trials of whether or not 
government supports, like, giving renters more income or whatever it is, reduces or increases 
homelessness. It reduces homelessness. 
So it's one of those things where, again, like it's technically true that we do not have sufficient 
data to fully disprove this theory, but all the data that we do have pushes against this idea. And 
also just common sense around how regular people would behave pushes against this idea. 
So I do think it's one of those things where people want to find something else to blame 
because the actual culprit is just really, really difficult to solve on a political level.

Is the American dream of owning a house…. a myth we should all let go 
of?

 

MIDROLL 2

Sean: I wanna circle back a little bit to what I was joking about earlier – about this, you know, 
the mythos of home ownership. And, you know, the story that we've all been told in this country 
about owning a home is pretty simple and at least superficially reasonable [LAFF] it's, you know, 
don't waste money on rent, buy a house, build equity, cash out later after the value of your 
house has increased. And then you just buy a nicer home. And so it goes, it's the American 
dream. 
Do you think that's A, wrong and B, something we really have to rethink or let go of in order to 
mitigate – I won't say solve, but mitigate – the problems we're talking about.
Jerusalem: I think the real problem with that message is how uniformly positive it is about home 
ownership for everyone at every stage at any point. 
What you have right now is a culture and a politics, which says to every single person, the 
second that you can buy a house, do so. And we reinforce that message by not caring, or trying 
to fix how bad the rental market is. If we actually thought that home ownership was a really 
meaningfully good choice, we wouldn't need to prop it up through all these financial gimmicks or 
whatever it is the federal government does to try to prop it up. 
We would not ignore how terrible the rental market is because honestly, a lot of people are 
choosing to own a house because the rental market is so bad that they're just trying to escape 
that reality. Whether it's not being able to have ownership over your space, like you can't paint 
the walls the way you want to, or you can't garden the way you want to, or you're at the behest 
of a landlord who might just pop in unannounced, or might just kick you out if he doesn't want 
you there anymore. And also at the lower end, really a threat of unfair, unreasonable and 
predatory eviction practices or whatever else is happening.
And so I think that's one of those things where meaningful choice towards home ownership is 
not being had in this country because we've made the alternative so terrible for most people that 
it's really the only thing you can do if you wanna have a secure future. 
And so largely my point, and I have this article for The Atlantic, about the Home Ownership 
society and rethinking it, is that it's a really heterogeneous experience. For a lot of people, 
owning a house is a great financial decision that works out well for you. 
For the marginal person, for the person right now who's considering buying a house, I think it's a 
really mixed bag. A lot of the properties that are available to you might be extremely old, in need 
of repair, might sink tons and tons more money into it. Climate change is making it such that a 
lot of properties that are at the affordable level for people are things that are going to potentially 
be destroyed by storms or fires or whatever.
I referenced a finding by NPR around how the department of housing and urban development, 
which was in a quintessential example of having like pro home ownership reign is attempting to 
push more and more people, especially, first time home buyers and people of color, into 
accessing home ownership, which sounds like a really great goal. And they end up pushing 
them to buy homes that are directly going to be flooded, with near certainty, in the next couple 
of years. And it's one of those things where it's, these homes have already flooded, this area 
has already flooded, and it will flood again. 
And it's one of those things where, do we actually think that the cult of home ownership is such 
an amazing thing to join, that we are saying to someone that it is better that you own a home 
that will likely experience this massive financial harm in the future. And also just like the 
personal harm and stress of having all your stuff flooded is obviously also terrible and is not 
really priced in. 
And so I think there are all these things like this that we don't consider when we tell people to 
buy houses that are really important.
Sean: Well that's also part of what makes it a bit of a shaky investment for lower and middle 
class people in particular because a lot of the wealth gains to be had are rooted in luck and in 
the places where you can be more sure of the value increasing – well, those are the places that 
are obscenely expensive to buy – and you can't, the barriers to entry are too high anyway, so 
you're kind of screwed.
Jerusalem: But even there, Sean, I think that's what's so crazy. Even there, in those places, 
like, would anyone three years ago have guessed that there would be a shock to labor markets 
that would allow people at high levels to move out of San Francisco and still work in tech? Like, 
remote work was not predicted by almost anyone at this level, like we have 20% of workers 
working at some level fully remote. I mean, that is unheard of. 
And it's one of those things where, that had had a massive impact on housing costs and I think 
people, I think that they can predict, they'll say like, oh well San Francisco, DC – that will always 
appreciate, we know that's gonna always appreciate. 
We don't know what's gonna happen, and we're telling people to put all their money there 
anyway.
Sean: This is related to the homelessness problem we're talking about, because we have this 
current dynamic of pushing people into buying houses, and at the same time we have this policy 
preference for never-ending rising housing prices. And that just punishes newcomers. It just 
makes it harder and harder and harder and harder for people to get into the home ownership 
game. 
When the music stops, there are a lot of people without a chair.
Jerusalem: Yeah. The fact that your property value is something means that, let's say we say 
your property value is $500,000. That means that there's someone willing to pay that, hopefully 
multiple people willing to pay that property value. The higher and higher it gets, right? Eventually 
it's like, who can afford like a 2 million house? Like, very few people can afford that. And that's 
what we're saying with constantly appreciating housing prices, that there should always be 
someone new, ready to pay that price. 
And at some point, the dam breaks, right? Like, at some point that there's not gonna be enough 
people to pay for that.
Sean: I mean, Part of the problem now – the homeless problem in particular – as that 
intensifies, people become more responsive to reactionary and draconian policies. They just 
wanna criminalize homelessness. They just wanna just get it the hell off my radar, get it off the 
streets, at all costs.
But in the end, that just ensures that the underlying problems will persist. Right. 
That's a road to nowhere, or nowhere good.
Jerusalem: I, I mean, I do think we're at a really bad inflection point here because people are 
so frustrated and fed up because of homelessness in particular, but also housing costs that 
they're willing to turn to really, really counterproductive policies. 
And this isn't just me saying this as like, I think it's pretty inhumane to just criminalize people 
who have nowhere to live. That's definitely a big part of it. 
But also, like, it doesn't work. You're telling someone who's homeless, it's illegal for you to camp 
here. It doesn't actually give them anywhere to go. In DC there was like local reporting which 
showed that people at a new encampment were just people who had been dispersed from old 
encampments, like, you have to actually have somewhere for them to be, in order to tell them to 
leave.
And, especially in California where there are not enough homeless shelter beds available for the 
population, it's kind of ridiculous to be like, oh, it's illegal for you to be here. Our attempts to 
criminalize poverty don't actually make poverty outlawed. Like, people are not poor by choice. 
And so it is one of those things which is really depressing, is that like, because we've really 
kicked the can down the road so much, at this point I'm not sure how much patience voters 
have for a solution which is really a long term one.
Sean: Yeah. And I just feel like as a society, we just don't really have an answer to a really 
basic question, which is, what do we owe our fellow human beings? Or, we have many 
answers, but certainly no consensus. 
And part of what's interesting to me about this problem is that it doesn't really collapse neatly 
along conventional, partisan, or ideological lines. There's never a perfect equivalent on 
anything. But the left and the right really don't have an answer for this. And they contribute in 
different ways to the problem. 
And in the interest of being real, like – I think a lot of people, most people perhaps, don't want to 
bear the cost of doing what's right here.
And the uncomfortable reality is that if you really drill down, a majority of people in this country 
have internalized our very hyper-individualistic culture, and many of us are comfortable and 
there's not a lot of appetite for real sacrifice. And maybe some of that has to do with the scarcity 
problem we were talking about earlier.
And maybe some of it is just the fact that this is a very libertarian society. And the bigger the 
country gets, the more atomized the country gets, the more these sorts of collective action 
problems become insoluble.
Jerusalem: Yeah, I mean, a couple of responses there. 
One is that it is the problem of regulatory constraints on building, housing infrastructure, other 
types of infrastructure. The truly libertarian response to that should be to allow for property 
rights, right? Like, if you own your house, you can paint it blue, you can, no homeowner's 
association or like overzealous local government can tell you you can't have your kid move into 
your garage. Like, that is the truly libertarian response here. 
And I think that's one of the things about this, this problem to me is that like, it should attract 
every ideology, like, leftists are in favor of building social housing building, uh, uh, and, and 
protecting lower income renters and, and in promoting a stable housing and rental environments 
for people.
Conservatives are very opposed to government intervention in this space. Libertarians similarly 
have those kinds of reactions, in theory. 
But I think what it comes down to is, while everyone kind of has these, like, fancy and theoretical 
ideologies at the theoretical level, what really matters is structure of government. When you 
have a local government that is in charge of permitting housing, that has the power to block 
infrastructure in general, it takes just a couple people to block it all. And that doesn't matter if 
98% of people are in favor. It just takes a lawsuit. You only need one person with a lawyer.
And the question here is how we have allowed this structure of government to proliferate and 
has a lot to do with the fact that we have deference towards the legal system as being the best 
way to resolve these kinds of disputes. And also because we fetishize local government and 
treat it as if it is closer to the people because it is smaller, but really it's a lot less representative 
because many fewer people vote or engage.
And so the really democratic outcomes, they don't happen at the local level. They happen at the 
state level or the federal level, or more so at the state level, federal level than they do there.
Sean: Yeah. I'm constantly searching for ways to explain a dynamic that exists in other spaces. 
Like healthcare in particular. 
So even if you're someone who, on a moral or ideological level, doesn't believe healthcare or 
housing is a human right, there's still the fact that as a society we are paying a price for these 
problems, one way or the other.
Don't give people healthcare? Well, they end up in the emergency room and that drives up cost. 
Don't provide housing livable wages, a basic social infrastructure to people? Crime and other 
social pathologies go up. You have more people that end up in prison. 
And we all pay for that, right? Like, there's no way we're not paying for this one way or the other. 
Jerusalem: Yeah. 
Sean: And so, like, pretending like the problem doesn't exist and just retreating into our 
libertarian cocoon, that's not gonna get the job done, that's not gonna make anything better. It's 
certainly not gonna make these problems go away.
Jerusalem: I thought Covid 19 would be much more of, like, a come-to-Jesus moment for a lot 
of people. Like, I mean, especially with housing, right? What we saw with homeless folks, 
homeless shelters were terrified about how to shelter people, especially in the winter, while the 
spread of Covid 19 could mean death or serious disability, or a number of things for both the 
homeless population. But also it's community spread. If more people in your community had 
covid, it was a public health issue. It wasn't an individual issue. 
And what was great is that that spurred a lot of places to start investing in converting hotel 
space into homeless shelters. That was a double whammy for communities because hotels had 
been depleted. And so getting that kind of funding input from public sector was able to tide them 
over. And it also gave homeless folks a real place to go. A lot of times people are like, well, I 
know someone who rejected going to a homeless shelter. 
And you have to recognize that a lot of homeless shelters are gender segregated. So it means 
you have to separate maybe from your partner, or even your children in order to go to a 
homeless shelter. They don't allow pets. And that may seem like a joke to some people. Like, a 
lot of people don't expect to become chronically homeless. Like, I have a dog and if I thought I 
was gonna be homeless for a week or so, I wouldn't just abandon my dog because, you know, 
it's like, from one week from now I'm gonna have a new place to live. The apartment I'm gonna 
be is gonna open up. 
And then also, can be quite dangerous, right? Like, there's a lot of victimization that can happen 
in these spaces. But with a hotel room, you have privacy, right? There's like, there's a door, 
there's a place to go to the bathroom that's private, that feels safe and secure. So there's a lot of 
innovation that happened there, and thankfully we're seeing some places take that seriously 
and think about converting hotel space and other places into homeless shelters in the future.
I agree with you. I think a lot of the times there's not a lot of solidarity here, which is sad, but I 
also think that it's not, you know, actually that important for solving this problem right now, 
because it is in everyone's interest that we deal with the housing cost problem. This is not 
something that is about charity for one person or another. This is gonna affect everyone. If 
there's not affordable housing for you or your kids where you need it to be, when we look at our 
universities, where there's no affordable housing for students or housing at all, like the rates of 
student homelessness have gone up. You're gonna send your kid to UC Berkeley, and they're 
not gonna have a place to live? Is that really the society, what we want? 
And, it really is going to become a systemic problem in every single sector, for higher education, 
for public health, for all these things.
Sean: You said it better than me. Even if you have some aversion to charity or, you can't help 
but think of people who have fallen, you know, into bad times as responsible in some way for 
their own plight.
This is still, even if that's your point of view, this is still in your interest to address. 
I think that's just a key point. So, I will leave it there. 
And I'll just say like, this was an education for me as someone who doesn't think about these 
sorts of questions very often. So thank you for helping me do it, Jerusalem.
Jerusalem: Yeah, happy to be here. Thanks for having me. 
Sean: And if you care about these problems at all, you should absolutely follow Jerusalem's 
work at The Atlantic. She is a terrific reporter and one of the best in this space, so check out her 
work.
