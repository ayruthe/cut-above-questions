|  0 | Rosa: You know, one of the things I also hear a lot of my friends who are still police officers  saying is this frustration. police departments like everybody else in the universe, they value what they can measure. And you can measure things like arrests. It's very hard to measure situations that were diffused that could have gone wrong.You know, it's the dog that doesn't bark in the night, right? And so they say, You go on YouTube and it's nothing but these terrible videos of police doing awful things. And you know, they, they've sort of naive. They're often sort of like, why aren't there videos of police doing good things ? Because we do good things all the time and they're not wrong, but.Nobody bothers to put on YouTube or is even recording in the first place. You know the interaction that goes really well, the interaction that's pleasant or the interaction where the police officer successfully diffuses a really tense situation and everybody goes away and it's resolved and it's not even forget the general public seeing those videos, right?Police express frustration that their sergeants don't see it either, and nobody. Is tracking or knows how to track who deescalated the most situations. And it's not that the cops don't know, right? They absolutely know. Institutionally it's not rewarded in part because it's hard to quantify, and that's part of the dilemma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Sean: Well, in the interest of ending this on a more constructive, optimistic note. You  mentioned the program that you, you help run at Georgetown for young cops in DC. This is a program where you talk about race and violence and the role of policing and all that stuff. Do you feel that work there is actually making a difference and giving you more hope?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | What is the main idea of the interview?              | What is the most important thing that you can do to help a police department? |
|  1 | Vienna: Yeah, I mean, I think the absence of self-love really intersects with these wounds,  right? Like when you don't feel deserving or good enough that there were conditions for love, right? I needed to perform, be perfect, be a people pleaser, be the comic relief, whatever it is in order to get connection, attention, love, presence, et cetera.Right? And maybe I should just name worthiness, belonging, prioritization, trust and safety are the five wounds that I go over. What we'll see is that those things strip away at our confidence. They strip away at the self, right? This belief that I belong as I am. So with a belonging wound, a lot of times families have this narrative, like this is what it looks like to be a part of this family. This is what we believe, this is what we do, this is how we show up in the world. And some of that is beautiful, right? The traditions that we have with a family, that might be lovely, but other parts of that are where we're asked to trade our authenticity for attachment. Dr. Gabor Mate talks about that being our two lifelines, attachment and authenticity.But when, when attachment is threatened, a child will trade authenticity in an instant in order to survive. And so we start to see how all of these things strip away from our capacity to hold ourselves in high regard, or even just regard. To pick ourselves up and believe that we are deserving of, to believe that we can just be ourselves, and that that is enough, to believe that we are important in the world, to believe that there are people in this world whom we can trust, or to believe that there is care and concern for our overall well being. And so self-love to me is not, you know, sure you wanna throw in some bubble baths and yeah, those are great things for us from time to time. But I talk about self-love as the intersection of grace and compassion for the self, as well as accountability and ownership.And we have to see ourselves as a part of the human experience, but we also need to take accountability and ownership. And when we don't do that, we're stuck. The self-critic is totally turned up right? That inner voice that just has a lot to say about who we are and what we're doing and doesn't seem to have any problems letting us know.And so, like, we stay stuck in that space instead of moving to a place of agency, I think you said before. Yeah. | Sean: The question of authenticity, about how as children we often trade our authenticity for  attachment, we start contorting ourselves very early. I certainly did for way longer than I should have for other people because that is the straightest line to acceptance. But that strategy does not work in the long run.I think you're right that it becomes a problem in our relationships, right? I mean, there are, there are, there are many different versions of this. I, I have my own. To not make this all about me. There's a case in the book, it's the gay man from West Virginia who is closeted for years, and he moves to New York City and finds himself in a relationship with someone who's wrapped up in the party scene and he's like playing along, but it's not really what he wants. He wants a quieter life, but he's stuck performing this role because he thinks he has to in order to be accepted by his partner and probably by his social circle. But no one can maintain that kind of pose forever, right?Like we gotta be who we are for the people we love, or they won't be able to love us and we won't be able to love ourselves. | What is the main idea of the interview?              | What do you think of the interview?                                           |
|  2 | Jerusalem: Yes. So the fundamental reason, and in particularly in these really high cost of  living cities and counties and suburbs, where the house, the homelessness crisis is most acute, is because it is illegal to build housing. And I wanna be clear here, what I mean is that in these places, you own a single family home that is on a lot where the city has said it must be minimum 10,000 square feet. And you are not allowed to tear that home down and build a house that is 9,000 square feet.You own this home and it is illegal for you to do this. And that is compounded by regulation after regulation. It's illegal for you to build a duplex on that lot. It is illegal for you to build a mother-in-law suite in your backyard on that lot. And what that does is that it compresses the number of housing opportunities that are available to people.And it also inflates the size artificially of the houses that are allowed to be built, which means that houses more and more are built to, over the course of the 20th century, we see houses being getting larger and larger. It used to be that you could find tons of starter homes, 1500 square feet, that would be like a first house that someone would buy, maybe when they're in their late twenties, early thirties.The supply of those starter homes is like dwindling to near non-existence, especially in these areas. What that means is that it becomes, you're raising the floor for what it means to buy a house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Sean: Is part of the story there cultural, like has home ownership became more and more of a  status symbol, I guess in some sense? That the drive to create bigger and bigger and bigger houses and have more space between houses, that this is all sort of like compounding and contributing to the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | What is the main reason for the homelessness crisis? | WHat is the problem with the housing market?                                  |
|  3 | Rosa: Sure. Yeah. They tend to be hierarchies that are modeled on military command  structures, you know, so there's a commander, they're captains, they're lieutenants and sergeants, and then the lowly patrol officers beneath them, and those commanders are themselves in a hierarchy that goes up to assistant chiefs and chiefs and so forth.So it tends to be a very rigid and hierarchical organizational structure. The training in most jurisdictions is kind of like a, a bad caricature of a 1980s marine boot camp. I mean, the military boot camps are not as boot campish as many police academies are anymore because the military figured out that this is maybe not a great way to train people if you want them to be developing critical thinking skills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Sean: Can you just give a little color there in terms of like, just so people have a visual, like  when you say they're training like it's 1980s Marine boot camp, is it the weapons they're using?

Why was that important given what you were trying to do in the book?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | What age is Noah's daughter?                         | Noah has a daughter and a son.                                                |
